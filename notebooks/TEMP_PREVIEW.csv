169,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Zocalo Central for a week in June. I chose this hotel because of a very positive previous experience years before. If anything, Hotel Zocalo Central was even better than the last time. Itâs a beautiful property a short walk from Plaza Central and a pedestrian mall lined with shops, restaurants, parks and museums. But itâs the staff that makes this hotel great. Here is an example. I had always wanted to see Lucha Libre, a colorful, dramatic and acrobatic Mexican version of WWE entertainment wrestling in the US. Emblematic of this Mexican form of wrestling, the Luchadores (wrestlers) wear colorful snug-fitting masks called mascaras. I asked at the desk, and they sent me to Leyka, the concierge. My last chance to attend Lucha Libre before we went home was at Arena Mexico the next evening. It was complicated to acquire a ticket and find a good seat at the last minute. Leyka took over and tracked down a ticket only five rows from ringside. I was so excited. The next day I stopped by to thank Leyka and she presented me with my own mascara de Luchador. It was as colorful and well-made as the ones worn by the Luchadores in the ring. That night I had such a great time. The pageantry of Lucha Libre features a Good vs Evil theme. The observers are very much involved in what's going on in the ring, and the arena throbbed with the passionate crowd. I feel very attached to Hotel Zocalo Central and will certainly stay there again.",[6],"nice, great, amazing, place, food"

182,"On a college trip to Mexico City with Canisius, I visited the heart of the cityâthe ZÃ³calo, which is the modern-day name for the main square. The experience was incredible, especially learning how this bustling plaza sits atop the ruins of the ancient city of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. This space, which today is surrounded by the grandeur of colonial-era architecture and governmental buildings, once housed the very center of the Aztec world. Itâs a living testament to Mexicoâs layered history.

As I stood in the square, I couldnât help but feel the weight of what was beneath my feet. Tenochtitlan, which was founded in 1325, was one of the largest cities in the world at its height, sitting on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco. The Aztecs engineered a sophisticated city with floating gardens (chinampas) and canals that rivaled those of Venice. The location of the ZÃ³calo itself was the site of Templo Mayor, a grand temple dedicated to the gods Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc. Although the Spaniards destroyed much of it during their conquest in 1521, you can still see remnants of the temple through archaeological excavations, which are visible right off the square.

The energy of the ZÃ³calo is palpableâwhether itâs the musicians playing traditional tunes, the street vendors selling indigenous crafts, or the vibrant political protests that sometimes fill the space. Itâs one of those places where the past and present seem to coexist so naturally. The knowledge that Tenochtitlan was a thriving metropolis, built with precision and spiritual significance, made me appreciate the enduring influence of Aztec culture on modern-day Mexico.

Walking through the nearby Museo del Templo Mayor and seeing artifacts, such as stone carvings, sculptures, and sacrificial altars, brought this history to life even more. I remember staring at a giant stone disc depicting Coyolxauhqui, the goddess dismembered by her brother Huitzilopochtli, in awe of how the Aztecs used art to tell their powerful myths.

Visiting the ZÃ³calo and understanding that it sits on the bones of Tenochtitlan, I realized how much of history can remain hidden beneath the surfaceâboth literally and figuratively. It was a profound experience that made me rethink how I view urban spaces, as every stone and structure seemed to have a story waiting to be uncovered. Itâs a reminder that cities are built on the legacies of civilizations past, and the ZÃ³calo is one of the best places to see those layers right in front of you.","[0, 6, 14]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, nice, great, amazing, place, food, service, fast, delicious, food, good"

You can have a four-course dinner here too, with multiple Mexican and international dishes on offer, and a spectacular view from the balcony by moonlight.. In addition, an attractive garden cafe bar, reached from above by a pleasing see-through lift, serves free food and drink to guests all day.

When we checked into the hotel it was lovely to be able to go down to the 24 Hr cafe and grab something to eat instead of having to search for food on our first day. The wraps, salads and soup were really delicious. I loved sitting on the balcony each morning for breakfast. Breakfast was pretty much the same thing each morning. Fabian was our waiter the whole visit and he was awesome. Loved the complimentary bottle of wine and the walking tour with Daniella. She was very informative, did not rush us and professional. My only complaint is the shower. The shower head is placed too high. I am short and my sister who is a little taller than me both stated it was hard to position the shower head without getting it all in face and hair. Also my sisters tv had Netflix option and mine did not but definitely wasnât a big deal because I rarely had it on.

We initially made a reservation through Booking.com, and it was a pre-established price (US$944.08). We even thought the amount had been charged to our card. However, I was surprised when I arrived at the hotel and was told that the reservation was only a pre-reservation and that I would have to pay the fees in the hotel lobby. The hotel attendant's attitude was extremely rude and impatient, as if we were the ones in the wrong. Not to mention that the ""pre-reservation"" price was not applied, and we paid a much higher amount than the amount stated at the time of booking. Since this initial attitude didn't seem like a mistake, but rather a dynamic, we checked the room rates on the day we checked in. The same room for the same number of days was US$835.00, while we had to pay US$1,558.07. We were extremely upset after the incident, but since there was no time to look for another place, we agreed to stay. In any case, the least a real hotel could do is refund the overcharged amount as quickly as possible.",[6],"nice, great, amazing, place, food"

There is a beautiful restaurant on the rooftop that overlooks Constitution Square where you can have the complimentary breakfast the hotel offers.

354,"Chapultepec Castle is located in the first section of Chapultepec Forest in Mexico City.
Its Baroque and Neoclassical design dates back to the Viceroyalty of New Spain, when the viceroys used to frequent Chapultepec to stroll and rest.
In 1840, the Heroic Military College established its headquarters in the castle. It also played a significant role in the Battle of Chapultepec as part of the American intervention in Mexico.
During the imperial transition, Maximilian of Habsburg and Charlotte lived in this castle, captivated by the beautiful views of the Valley of Mexico.
The castle also served as the presidential residence for most of the Mexican Revolution and until 1938.
A decree was issued requesting that the castle be used as the headquarters of the National Museum of History, and it opened its doors to the public for the first time on September 27, 1944.
Chapultepec Castle is the only castle in Latin America to have served as the official residence of a monarch.
It is open Tuesday through Sunday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
General admission is 100 pesos and is free for children under 13, adults over 60, people with disabilities, and students and teachers with a valid ID.

It is simply a beauty. Founded in 1570, the first stone was laid in 1571. Its construction took approximately 250 years, and it was inaugurated in 1813. It stands 67 meters high and covers an area of 7,752 mÂ².
It is designed in Gothic, Plateresque, Baroque, Estipite, and Neoclassical styles.
It is a monument that dominates the ZÃ³calo of Mexico City and is a must-see. The main altar, the Altar of the Kings, the Altar of Forgiveness, the naves and altars of the apse, the 14 chapels, the sacristy, the chapter house, the crypts, the remaining organs, the choir stalls, and the pendulum are all worth seeing and admiring for their beauty.
You can also climb the cathedral towers with a guide and admire the bell towers.
Admission is free, but climbing the bell towers and roofs costs 250 pesos per person.","[0, 10, 14]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, pretty, negative, cdmx, delivery, positive, service, fast, delicious, food, good"

It allows us to identify what our ancient civilization was like, with those models and drawings that represent our historical past. Walking through its wide corridors resembles the corridors that the ancient inhabitants of this region walked through. Seeing their images or their representations in those three-dimensional shapes makes us understand the magnitude, strength, and intelligence that went into constructing those buildings and temples, as well as their worship of their gods. It also helps us understand their way of thinking and their messages engraved in paintings and reliefs. I particularly enjoy walking in this area full of stories from our ancient colonizers.

I sent what felt like 20 emails to the hotel asking them to cancel the additional charge. I either received no response at all, or they blatantly lied to me, saying it was just a deposit and that my bank would release it. I didn't receive a response to my reply that it was clearly a card charge and that I could clearly tell the difference.

Also, there are several, museums, historical buildings, shops and  restaurants (all categories and prices) at a walking distance.

The central part, just down there at ZÃ³calo and some other streets are just for pedestrians. So one can have very nice walking time there (early in the morning perhaps the best time as it is not to crowded)

Wear comfortable clothing; the descent is easier.

I don't recommend bringing strollers or wheelchairs, as mobility isn't yet adapted.

- Bring a healthy lunch. Outside, they sell various snacks, chips, and food, but the prices are excessive, and I don't think the quality is the best.

- It's best to go inside the restrooms; there are long lines outside the castle, and you'll have to wait a long time.

Great value for the price!!  The breakfast was fabulous and the 24 hr free cafe service pretty much makes this place an ""all-inclusive"".  We would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in the Historic district of Mexico City.

525,"We visited this restaurant on a Friday night, catching the tail end of their busy hour. The host greeted us and mentioned a 20-minute wait, jotting our name and number on a piece of paper. Interestingly, other guests and reservations appeared to be managed through a tablet system, so it felt a bit disorganized from the start.

We waited outside and noticed several larger parties being seated ahead of us. Assuming they had reservations, we waited patiently. However, after a while, we decided to check inâonly to realize that the hostess had clearly forgotten us. She seated us shortly after.

Our server was polite but seemed to lack proper training. She took our appetizer and drink orders together, then returned with drinks and took our dinner order. We received our entrÃ©es, but had to remind her about the appetizers, which arrived late. One of the meals came out incorrectly, but to her credit, she did correct it fairly quickly.

When it came time to pay, confusion set in. We had clipped our cards to the respective tabs, but the charges appeared to be mixed up. To avoid further complications, we covered the difference between ourselves. Later, we discovered that one card was charged twice, instead of charging the two separate cards provided.

As for the foodâit was underwhelming.

Overall, the experience was more frustrating than enjoyable.",[6],"nice, great, amazing, place, food"
526,"Here is a review from someone straight from Mexico, these tacos suck! The place is super cute, horchata surprisingly good but the tacos are not good, I got asada and they are very blend donât have any flavorâ¦ not worth 6 dls a taco.

537,"Came here with a group of 7 and overallâ¦ it was underwhelming. Our server was decent at first, but once he realized the tip was automatically included, we barely saw him again; meanwhile, the smaller tables got the real attention. My plate honestly felt a little sad because the chicken was dry and lacked flavor. Also, for a brunch spot, not offering coffee is just wild to me.

The atmosphere and aesthetic were actually really nice, the space is bright and well put together, and the swings are a fun touch that definitely add to the vibe. But that only goes so far.

A $16+ breakfast burrito feels like a stretch. I know prices are up, but breakfast should be more accessible, not a luxury. Drinks were okay. I also tried the lobster quesadilla, and while it sounded fancy, it barely had any lobster despite the price.

All in all, great setting, but the food and service didnât live up to it. Not in a rush to come back.","[6, 10]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, pretty, negative, cdmx, delivery, positive"

In essence, the catacomb / crypt tour is only on Fridays from 11am to ~4pm. I forget how much admission was, but it was pretty cheap (~$5 USD). You can only buy tickets in person from a guide posted in front of the middle chamber of the church; cash only.

The tour is ONLY in Spanish. You will see one or two side chambers of the church, then the middle chamber with the giant organs (some or the largest in North America), then descend steps from there down to the crypts.

I appreciate that there is an elevator, since we have a handicap person with us.  I must warn you that the hike up to the castle is quite long and I saw a few people nearly passing out.  But I think that if you are moderately active, the hike might be difficult but not impossible.  Beware of the food vendors in the food section. We ordered chicken and broth and were charged 90 pesos, for a very small bowl.  That was 20 pesos more than what I paid for a huarache with sudadero, which was larger and with more meat.  This was at the section with the blue umbrellas.  Our server forgot our order, when he finally brought it it was incomplete.  The chicken broth was not on the menu, so we didn't know the price.  It was my mistake for not asking the price before hand.  When I question him about the excessive cost, he said it was because it must of had a lot of chicken.  With prices in Mexico they would have to use half a chicken to justify the price.  Other than that insident, our trip was great.  You need the whole day to be able to explore more of Chapultepec.

We tried the quesabirria tacos, carnitas taco, fajita plate and the sopaipillas. The food wasnt flavorful and the birria sauce was bland. Rice seemed like it was from a box. Sopaipillas were ok but not soft like Im used to. However the 2 things that were super delicious was the bacon & beer queso and elote en vaso. Id say the food wasnt worth the price. Our waitress was awesome though.

Big mistake. We came in just for drinks, and despite the place being nearly empty, it took 15 minutes to get them. The margarita tasted like warm tequila mixed with store-bought syrup and water. My friend asked for a tequila soda with extra lime â it showed up with no lime. Service was slow and careless.

626,"I was struggling to give 4 or 5 but after thinking about the housekeeping I give a 4

As mentioned the housekeeping is a disappointment. We left the room every morning and back around 4 with the clean room sign hanging at the door. The room was not cleaned and untouched. We had to ask them to come and clean them again around 5. I understand that was the busiest time of the year but not cleaning your room for such a long time. Guests just want a clean room to rest after a long day out

The gym is very small as people mentioned. The absurd thing is you cannot go to the gym on the first floor with your key card. You need to go to the reception and ask them to get you to the 1/f

The hotel is stylish and I like it
We also like the concept they give free drinks but the coffee is bad. It is coffee water not coffee .. I donât know how

The location is a plus and minus. The plus side is you can easily access to the busiest area of the city and zocalo for sights and experience

The minus was since it was around Christmas time most of the time cars cannot get close to the hotel. The first time we came by taxi it took us triple the time and the taxi could not get into the hotel with all roads blocked
For the next coming days we could not get taxi right at the the hotel or dropping off at the spot
You simply need to walk 5 mins away from the busiest area to get the transportation

Other than these problems I would recommend to stay there but not during Christmas or festival times","[0, 6, 7]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order"

I understand that one is Latino and perhaps the service is not the same as that provided to foreigners like Gringo. Some food service employees reluctantly take your order. I know they think they are giving away the food because it is included with the hotel reservation, which is not a cheap rate. Now in the suite we stayed in, we returned around 8pm and the bathroom was leaking water from the ceiling, they sent someone to fix it, which is fine, but they didn't give us another bedroom option and afterward they didn't talk to us to see if everything was okay, they didn't take much notice of it. I see and feel that the American is given more attention than the Latino or the Mexican himself if one also goes and pays and spends. In summary, I recommend that you please retrain all employees in customer service because without customers there is no central socket. suite 415 thank you.","[0, 7]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, food, service, bad, tacos, order"

This is more of an upscale place with high end food choices and pricey drinks.  For two, we had the 4 course option, 3 drinks and glass of wine, was about 250.00 dollars.  To put that in perspective the day before for a group of 8, I spent about the same amount at cafe Tacuba.  That being said the atmosphere is great you will feel and know you are in a high end place, the minute you step off the elevator.   There will be no confusion, that you will be paying more for your meal than some Mexicans makes in almost a month (I Googled that info). As for the service it was on point. After each meal, my fork was replaced with a clean fork.  Also the views, at night from the balcony facing the Cathedral are amazing.  As for the food it was good, but I personally cannot justify the price to the portions.  If you are a regular sized guy you will, leave hungry I am 6,2 at 250 and was ready to go get me some street tacos afterward.  But of course for the ladies they were perfect portion size.  The food is good, I would not say great, and it is very much so, fancy Mexican food, or foo foo food.  Hopefully this will help you to decide if this is for you or not.","[0, 6, 7]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order"

894,"We ordered the chefs choice menu with a group of 8. The lentil soup was cold and tasted unfortunately like boiled water with lentil and a few pieces of pork belly. No flavor. The bruschetta was not good. Bread was very hard and tasted stale. The white fish and the steak were great. Desserts were good. Got charged for an extra water of Perrier and got charged for a more expensive drink than the one I ordered. They did mess up two items but handled the situation very well. Quite frankly for the price, I would not recommend this place unless you value view over food and value. I also had a similar average experience last year where one of the main dishes was horribly over salted.

The service was always good but understaffed with servers so getting their attention is hard - not their fault. They were so polite just not enough of them.",[6],"nice, great, amazing, place, food"

957,"Zocalo was recommended, and it did not disappoint. Their menu is creative and has some great twists on Mexican cuisine.

Started with the Chips & Salsa. Fresh crispy chips fresh out the fryer and very tasty salsa with a good kick. I tried several of their tacos and they were all great. Tacos I tried: Panela Mushroom, Steak Chimichurri, El Macho, Quesabirria, and Eaquites. To wet my taste buds, I had the Ancho Old Fashion. And it was delicious.

Abigail, our server, was great. Friendly and very attentive. Constantly checked in on us. Followed her suggestions, and they were great.

I recommend Zocalo to everyone.","[6, 13]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, city, mexico, center, beautiful, historic"
958,Cute spot. Good variety of options. The salsa was super tasty. One less star since the carnitas taco was too rich and fatty for my liking.,[6],"nice, great, amazing, place, food"
959,"Update 5 months later : Completely unprofessional and inappropriate sanitary standards.

Staff is serving while munching on their snacks. It's super unsanitary. And who wants a server talking to you while they're still chewing their food? Or putting the lime in their Corona, when they haven't washed their hands and just munched on chips and salsa.

The staff seemed largely distracted by consuming their own snacks/ meals any chance they got. Even my date questioned from the moment we walked in, ""why is the staff eating/ chewing"" he thought they were having a staff party or get together.

The chicken quesadilla we had (and had previously on a separate visit) was not as good as the previous time and served with no salsas. The Chili Rellanos were mediocre.

The entire visit was such a turn off due to the staff eating and not washing their hands.

We did speak to the manager and I expressed my concerns and even emailed the owners. This is unacceptable.

I don't recommend.

Initial review: Spunky, Delicious. NOISY.

- review based off of 2 visits 2 days apart.

a fun spot with tasty food. Only complaints the noise, and inconsistency in hours posted on the doors.

Really not cool guys- for the customers or your employees. If you close at 10- UPDATE THE DOORS.

SO HOURS ARE NOT TRUSTWORTHY!!!

You basically have to yell at the person next to you because of the music being so loud and all the other people yelling to talk.

Other than that.  Great food except for the guacamole appetizer which was bland, granted we ordered the mango and tajin on the side.

They accommodated our request for a chicken quesadilla *ZOCALO*- add it to the menu, it was one of the best chicken quesadillas! Thank you for accommodating our request.

Drinks, especially the margaritas are STRONG.

The swings look like fun and since I will return to enjoy a seat on the swings, I suppose Iâd recommend them.

962,"I finally met the cook called Sergio and what a pleasure it was! He's a master at his craft, yet so humble and down to earth. Abigail took care of service today and at least once before and she's so attentive and professional. I don't remember who all I've had for servers before except for Angelo, an excellent bartender, but  every single time I come in, I'm absolutely impressed by every detail of my experience. My first visit was no more than a couple of months ago and I've visited probably 10 times since. I waited until today to write a review because I was looking for some reason to temper all this praise with at least one thing I found them lacking in, because nothing is perfect.... But Zocalo is reliably perfect. So shout out to manager Ashley, because though we haven't met, you're obviously doing things right.

I've tried several of the street tacos here and I love them all, but el pastor is #1. I've searched high and low for pastor in the Springs only to be disappointed. Zocalo is so far above the rest, it's ridiculous.

By the way, their happy hour deals are crazy, I feel like I'm stealing from them. The atmosphere is incredible, the decor is beautiful, and I'm a patron for life!","[6, 7]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order"

981,"Looks like AI wrote a business plan for a ""trendy"" mexican restaurant and the owner followed it to the  T. The table water was served warm in a bottle with food chunks in it. The swing chairs are pretty much impractical and poorly made (unstable due to one chain on each side). Barely give you any chips with your guacamole and even though we had a party of five they didn't even give small plates to divide up the guacamole or chips.

The food was meh. Nothing I will ever remember either good or bad.

The service was similar.  Not bad. Not good. Zero personality in the staff. Almost like they were mildly inconvenienced by having to hold a job and make money to support themselves.

1029,"Going up to the ZÃ³calo Balcony is, from the outset, a promise: the city at your feet, the sunset gilding the Cathedral, and a chef's menu that, at least on paper, promises a sensory experience worthy of the highest standards.

And in the kitchen, it delivered.
The Lentil Soup was a warm, profound start, with flavors that seemed to come from a kitchen steeped in history. The beef fillet sope, small but powerful, struck a perfect balance between traditional and refined. The Totoaba Loinâsimply sublimeâcooked to the point of perfection. And the chocolate cheesecake, elegant without being pretentious, rounded out with a wine pairing that complemented it without stealing the show. It was, without exaggeration, a first-class execution. Cuisine that walks firmly down the runway of the memorable.

But then, the service.
There, the narrative changed. Long silences. Gazes searching for someone who hadn't come. Dishes that never arrived, but were still charged for. A service pace so rushed that you doubted whether you were dining or racing against the clock. And the final irony: after the last bite, we were asked to leave a review.

So here it is:
A cuisine with vision and technique, the kind you'd recommend without a second thought. But marred by service that seemed improvised, as if a museum painting had been hung with thumbtacks.

In a place where the cuisine is top-notch, the service can't afford to be grounded. Because when you dine at the BalcÃ³n del ZÃ³calo, you don't just expect a meal. You expect an experience.

1046,"Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral: Jewel of the Capital's ZÃ³calo
The Metropolitan Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven in Mexico City stands as one of the most emblematic and majestic monuments in Latin America, dominating the north side of the ZÃ³calo or Plaza de la ConstituciÃ³n in the heart of Mexico City's Historic Center.
History and Construction
The history of this monumental cathedral dates back to the colonial period. After the conquest of Mexico-TenochtitlÃ¡n, HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s ordered the construction of a first major church in 1524, built with stones from destroyed indigenous temples and strategically located where the four causeways leading to the Aztec spiritual center converged. However, this initial construction soon proved insufficient for the spiritual needs of the viceroyalty's capital. Construction of the current cathedral formally began in 1573, under the direction of the Spanish architect Claudio de Arciniega, who was inspired by the cathedrals of JaÃ©n and Valladolid. The project represented a titanic undertaking that spanned 240 years, concluding in 1813 under the direction of architect Manuel TolsÃ¡.
Architectural Features
The cathedral is an extraordinary compendium of architectural styles that reflects the different periods of its construction. Its main faÃ§ade displays the Renaissance, Baroque, and Neoclassical styles that developed during the Viceroyalty. The dimensions of the temple are impressive: 61 meters wide by 128 meters long and 67 meters high to the top of the towers.
The interior consists of five naves with a transept, with 51 vaults, 74 arches, and 40 columns. The structure includes fourteen side chapels, each with its own character and artistic treasures. The floor is made of Tepeaca marble, and its walls and vaults are made of stone.
Artistic Treasures
Among the most notable artistic treasures is the Altar of the Kings, considered one of the masterpieces of Churrigueresque Baroque in the Americas. This magnificent work was created by JerÃ³nimo de BalbÃ¡s between 1718 and 1725, and gilded by Francisco MartÃ­nez in 1736. The altarpiece measures 25 meters high, 13 meters wide, and 7 meters deep, and is made of carved white cedar wood covered with gold leaf. The Altar of Forgiveness, also by JerÃ³nimo de BalbÃ¡s, is located in the central nave along with the Cathedral Choir, which features two magnificent organs. The paintings decorating the Altar of the Kings are by the prominent artist Juan RodrÃ­guez JuÃ¡rez, including ""The Assumption of the Virgin Mary"" and ""The Adoration of the Magi.""
The ZÃ³calo: Historical Context
The cathedral is located in Constitution Square, popularly known as the ZÃ³calo, which, at 46,800 square meters, is the second largest square in the world after Tiananmen Square. This square was named in honor of the CÃ¡diz Constitution promulgated in 1812. The term ""ZÃ³calo"" comes from the base built during the government of Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna to erect a commemorative column of independence. The foundation was never completed, but its base remained in place for several years. Since pre-Hispanic times, this space has been the spiritual, political, and cultural center of Mexico, serving as the setting for important historical events.
World Heritage Site
The Metropolitan Cathedral, along with the Historic Center of Mexico City, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1987.

The menu here is Mexican street food - tacos, nachos, etc.  The food is delicious and reasonably priced, although not cheap.  Tacos were priced around $5 each when I visited.

The nachos were delicious and easily serve 2.

The college-aged host seemed completely lost but our server was top notch.

If your out doing a Tejon Street bar crawl with friends or stoned, Zocalo is the perfect place for a casual dinner.",[8],"place, wonderful, visit, castle, great"
1055,"Sergio is the owner and he serves food, talks to patrons and I can see how much his staff admire him. Everyone was happy. The staff all have good vibes and with Sergio leading, I can see he sets the tone. The food is so fresh and seasoned so perfectly. Sergio said that his recipes come from old Mexico City, very traditional. The margaritas are so delicious and they use fresh juices, no store bought mix. I had the Classico with Mezcal, instead of tequila. It comes with a sun-dried lime and has perfect balance. Not too sweet, not bitter, not too acidic, and a perfect amount of liquor. I love the refried beans-smooth, seasoned so well and a little touch of imported Mexican cheese that is nutty, and actually has flavor, as opposed to the normal bland cheese that many other restaurants serve. The Mexican rice has a hint of saffron with rich tomatoes. I usually donât eat the rice but this rice is irresistible. I had the fajitas, the combo of steak and shrooms. The steak is smokey, with a tangy mouth-watering dose of lime. The shrooms are meaty and would make a great vegan or vegetarian meal. It comes with red peppers and onions that still have a bit of crunch. The chips are perfectly cooked, crisp and seasoned. They come in a brown paper bag and if your lucky, they may be right out of the fryer. The ambiance is fun and they have swings to sit on. The kids will love this and so do the adults. The music is also great. Sergio wanted me to try the birria taco and gave me one for free. So damn good. He also gave me some tamales to take home. He told me he likes to keep his prices reasonable and they are. Do yourself a favor, and eat there. I promise, you will leave happy. I canât remember any restaurant owner giving free food, sitting at your table to talk about where you are from and expressing gratitude for dining at their establishment. Times have changed, but at Zocalo, you feel valued and to me, that means so much.","[0, 6, 7]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order"

It's a pleasant stay here, the staff is friendly, and the location is enviable, practically overlooking Mexico City's main square. The panoramic terrace on the sixth floor where breakfast is served is truly enviable and unique. Like all roses, this beautiful property also has its thorns. Being in the center, it's a bit noisy, with frequent alarms and disturbing noises at night. Breakfast is plentiful, but many dishes are Ã  la carte, so you have to request them on the spot. I personally prefer rich buffets and not having to constantly ask. The service staff could use a review. At 8:15, they knock on your door and ask if the room is free for cleaning.

I have to say there was definitely plenty of meat on the carnitas taco, and the taste was ok. The quesabirria taco was better but very small. We ordered chips & salsa for $6.50 as you don't get any without ordering & paying for it. I'd say the salsa was delicious. We didn't order any drinks, just water. The water wasn't cold, no ice & we were given these little tin cups. Overall, I was disappointed and won't be returning. Save yourself $ and get your quesabirria tacos at Monica's instead.

The price of the menu depends on the choice of main course, ranging from approximately 850 to 1,300. It's worth noting that drinks are separate.

The dishes are beautifully presented and the portions adequate. Although the appetizer and snack are small, the main course is enough to satisfy.

The view of downtown Mexico City, which allows you to see the ZÃ³calo, and therefore the National Palace and the Mexico City government building, as well as the cathedral, is worth it.","[0, 14]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, service, fast, delicious, food, good"

We tried clam ceviche, tortilla soup, tacos, and the exquisite fish loin and steak.
If you're a wine lover, they offer wines by the glass starting at $250 or $1,200 by the bottle.

Which sucked since the place is charging around $6 a taco, and most cocktails are going to run around $13+. It is not cheap to eat out at this establishment to say the least. It is pretty pathetic though if Iâve been sitting at my table for 20 minutes, and a server has yet to even say Hello, much less take our drink order. They were closing at 9pm on this night, and we had come in about 10-15 minutes before 8pm. The restaurant was not busy by any means. I could count the amount of tables being taken up by other guests on 1, maybe 2 hands. Having worked in the food industry before, what I saw was pure laziness and lack of caring. Most of the staff (other than the gentleman bussing the tables) was too busy trying to do their closing shift tasks, talking to each other, hanging out by the POS stand. So much that they honestly couldâve cared less about the guests or their dining experience. What an absolute disappointment, especially since the manager (or owner, I donât know) was there, and let this piss poor service go by unnoticed with not just us, but others guests.","[6, 7]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order"

The horn on the bus was an interesting shtick, but maybe with a little insulation or decrease the voltage to quiet it slightly.

Will definitely be back.","[6, 10]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, pretty, negative, cdmx, delivery, positive"
1208,"We went here with some friends for lunch. Solid place! Not the best tacos Iâve ever had (pastor and a beef taco) but not the worst. Solid 7/10. Out favorite thing was the atmosphere and the open space and lighting.
It just seems like theyâre getting their feet set with learning how to run a restaurant well? With service not being very quick or professional. Nice people, though. My biggest disappointment was that when the waiter went around to give people their digital bills, he did not say that there was a group fee (20% for our group of only 8) and all I saw on the screen was the total. So I of course added a tip and paid. Thought the price seemed a little high so I sent myself a receipt and then found out about the group tip already added. The whole table ended up tipping twice.
I hope it was just an oversight on his end. But either way, not very professional as a server. Or more so as the restaurant for not training their servers to communicate this up front to their customers/guests.",[6],"nice, great, amazing, place, food"

1246,"Some positives:

The happy hour pricing is great, so sometimes we go for happy hour. The $3 tacos are very, very generously-sized for the price, and the chips+salsa are good. I often order grilled fish tacos, which are generally tasty and very filling. For non-HH dining, there are lots of options for carnivores to vegans and most things are intrinsically gluten free. It's nice to have a menu that is geared slightly more toward southern Mexico. The margaritas are done well and the beer selection is appropriate to the venue.

However, there are some pretty consistent issues:

The place smells intensely of the fryer. If you wear a jacket in, it will still smell awful a few days later. Not subtly either; the people around you will notice how awful you smell. This has been the case since they opened, and it's the primary reason we take breaks from Zocalo.

Certain food items are a little rough. The fried fish is grey and slimy and unpleasant to eat. The carne asada is grey and bland. Food items have come out with small mistakes regularly, such as missing salsa or a taco that was never garnished at all.

The beer is sometimes flat. I think there's a bit of a line pressure issue that a distributor could solve.

The range in quality of service is from awful to pretty good, with no clear indication of why it's sometimes so bad. We're often ignored for too long/indefinitely, or the order is taken wrong, or there's an issue with the check (or the gratuity entered at the end of the shift). Sometimes they are understaffed but we've noticed the same problems when they are heavily staffed.

Overall, the issues aren't enough to totally take away our desire to eat there occasionally, especially given happy hour pricing, but solving those issues would greatly enhance the experience.","[0, 7]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, food, service, bad, tacos, order"

1251,"The service at this restaurant was one of the worst Iâve experienced in a long time. The fact that it took 10 minutes for the waitress to bring chips and salsa shouldâve been a warning for what was to come. We had chips and salsa that sat empty for 20 minutes. We also had our water bottle empty for well over 20 mins needing a refill. We looked all over for her to ask for a refill but did not see her for a while. Eventually she passed us after giving another table chips and salsa and still did not refill our chips or water. We continued to wait 30-40 minutes for our food, which for 2 people, is pretty excessive, weâre assuming she forgot to put in our order. Over that span of time we saw her maybe 2 times. She eventually came over when we flagged her down and she asked to refill the salsa. She came back with only the salsa and forgot the chips. She came back and said the chips were out and they were refrying them. When our food came finally came out she forgot both of our tacos and had to go back and get them. Then about 20 mins later after promising chips, she returned, but we were already finishing up. We waited another 15 minutes waiting for our check which never came so we had to go to the bar and ask them to get our waitress.

Overall, terrible service. Waitress will ignore and neglect you. The food isnât bad but for the service and time it takes to receive your food, youâre better off eating elsewhere. Iâd only recommend if youâre in a pinch for places open, not if youâre in a pinch for time. This would be the worst place to go if youâre in a pinch for time.","[6, 7]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order"

We ordered three drinks and some appetizers (nachos with cheese and guacamole with moles), and the moles were runny, the guacamole was old, the cheese was awful, and the nachos were watery. When we asked the waitress if she could take the appetizers away, she said yes, and when it was time to pay, they charged us for everything. We tried to come to an agreement, but the waitress refused.

1308,"Iâm new to town and was looking for a Mexican food place with good chow and fun ambiance for a Saturday night. Look no further mi amigos! This place is swingin (pun intended - the bar swing seats are great for the kids). The horchata is so creamy and the sprinkled cinnamon adds a nice touch. Little weird to see a charge for chips and salsa, but after having them Iâd gladly try again (next time with guac!) - they were crispy, lightly oiled, and salty. Kids had the enchiladas - they went with server Katieâs recommendation of beef with red sauce and chicken with green. These meals come with rice and beans, but tacos do not. My wife and I had the tacos, which did not disappoint - the carne asada is bigger than normal but is delicious. I also tried the quesabirria and shrimp, also good (although the shrimp was breaded and I prefer grilled). The highlight of the night was when I asked for spicier salsa. Katie went back and asked Sergio if they had any and he just whipped me up a phenomenal chili diarbo, Serrano, habenero salsa. He came out to check on us and insisted we try the salsa in the el macho - pretty fantastic as well!

This is the my top favorite besides Onion and Garlics restaurant in Pueblo. I also had a spicy margarita and it was good, but got even better with more jalapeÃ±os added lol I like spicy. Oh and there chips and salsa is the best out of any other restaurant that I have been to. They make there own tortillas and that's what made the chips the best all around.

1361,"The Historic Center of Mexico City is a fascinating place that encapsulates centuries of history, culture and architecture. Walking through its streets is like taking a trip back in time, where each corner reveals a part of the rich heritage of the Mexican capital.

One of the main attractions is the ZÃ³calo, one of the largest squares in the world, surrounded by impressive buildings such as the Metropolitan Cathedral and the National Palace, which houses the famous murals by Diego Rivera. These sites offer an in-depth look at the history and art of Mexico.

The Templo Mayor, located just steps from the ZÃ³calo, is another highlight. The Aztec ruins and adjacent museum allow visitors to explore the city's pre-Hispanic past. As one ventures deeper into the Historic Center, one finds streets full of life, vibrant markets, and a variety of shops and restaurants offering everything from traditional crafts to delicious Mexican food.

The Historic Center is also home to important museums, such as the Museo del Palacio de Bellas Artes, known for its impressive Art Nouveau architecture and interior murals, and the Casa de los Azulejos, with its facade covered in Talavera tiles. The mix of colonial, modern and pre-Hispanic buildings creates a unique and charming urban landscape.

Visiting the Historic Center of Mexico City is an enriching experience that offers something for everyone: history, culture, art, gastronomy and vibrant urban life. It is a place where the past and present coexist harmoniously, inviting visitors to explore and discover the essence of Mexico City.","[0, 14]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, service, fast, delicious, food, good"

Hereâs what we loved:
- Phenomenal service: due to the teacher protest we were late for our reservation but they waited patiently for us to arrive; waitstaff was always helpful, quick to refill water/drinks and never skipped a beat with our questions about the menu.
- drinks were unique and exceptionally tasty
- views of Plaza de ConstitutiÃ³n and the buildings were incredible.
- food was top notch!  Our group chose to do the pick 3 option on the menu: Tirana ceviche, shrimp taco, filet taco, octopus, tlacoyo tacos, totoaba filet on mole, heirloom tomato salad, rib-eye, everything was absolutely delicious!
- perfect portion-size
- never felt rushed to finish an item
- heaters were flanking our table which helped as the temperature cooled outside.

Things I would change if we could:
- our choices of clothing! We were right at the front of the balcony which was fantastic for the amazing views but it was quite windy. I would have worn nice pants and brought a thicker sweater.
- prepare for a lot of traffic getting there especially if there is a protest going on (we had to walk the last few blocks due to road closures associated with the teachersâ protest).",[6],"nice, great, amazing, place, food"

We booked a reservation weeks in advance, very excited to experience the cuisine and take in the incredible view from this restaurant. Upon our arrival in the city, we learned that there was a massive protest happening obstructing the view and making it difficult to travel to the area. As soon as we learned of this, we reached out to the restaurant. Because it was the same day they charged us $70 CAD. I asked if there was any way under the circumstances they could wave the charge. I was told that was not possible. I am very disappointed the restaurant did not notify us of the protest when they reached out to confirm the reservation the day prior and they werenât willing to do anything about the charge.

For the second course, a tlacoyo, to be honest, was unbelievable, delicious, I would go back just for that dish.
For the third course, I think it was a sea bass loin. It was supposed to be juicy, unfortunately, it came out dry, I think it was overcooked or overcooked in the pan.
For the last course, I don't quite remember what its name was, like a chocolate volcano cake, but it was rectangular. Honestly, it stung me. I don't know if it had too much cinnamon or another ingredient that I can't really identify.
I would go back, maybe, but in the future.","[6, 10]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, pretty, negative, cdmx, delivery, positive"
1485,View is great. Food and service 0/5 we went for lunch and the only option they have was the 4 course meal which honestly who wants to eat 4 meals for lunch. $1150 pesos ($60) for the courses I think it was too expensive. They donât have an option for appetizers more than individual meals which the cheapest was $850 pesos ($43) the waiter was not happy that we were taking too long to order but the menu was very confusing. I ordered the tenderloin steak and I asked for medium and came rare. They took it back so for sure they just put it in the microwave because everything was soggy. So I donât recommend this place. Stay away,"[6, 7]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order"
1486,"DO NOT EAT HERE â They will steal from you and ignore you.

I had a very frustrating and disappointing experience at Balcon de Zocalo in Mexico City. While the food and views were beautiful, our visit was ultimately ruined by dishonesty and terrible customer service.

Last year, I went with a friend who attempted to pay with his Capital One card. The first card didnât work, so he tried a second one, which also didnât go through. When he went back to the first card, it finally worked. The staff assured us that the failed transactions were voided and would not be charged.

That turned out to be false. Both âvoidedâ transactions went through, and we were charged multiple times for one meal. Weâve been trying to get our money back since June of last year, and despite countless emails and calls, weâve gotten nothing but empty promises. We even had a Spanish-speaking friend from El Salvador call on our behalf, and they hung up on her. That kind of behavior strongly suggests a lack of honesty and integrity.

Weâve also reached out repeatedly on Instagram and Facebook for almost a yearâagain, no resolution. All weâve asked for is a simple receipt to prove to Capital One that the duplicate charges were fraudulent, and they refuse to provide even that.

It's deeply upsetting to be out hundreds of dollars after being told we wouldnât be charged. As tourists, we expected more from a place as prominent as Balcon de Zocalo. If you're an American or international visitor, avoid paying by card hereâyour money may not be safe.

What could have been a lovely experience turned into a nightmare. It's a shame that such a well-known establishment would operate in this way. Be warned","[6, 7]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order"

1488,"I'd been there before, but I didn't like it this time; I'll delete it from my list. As for the menu, you must have all three courses. The flavor wasn't spectacular, but it lacked something extra, a more sophisticated flavor for the concept I believe they're proposing. The dishes were very cheesy and overpriced for the price. The mole had no mole at all, the octopus was undercooked, the dessert was spicy, and the risotto was tough and flavorless; the cheese overpowered any subtlety of the dish. The drinks were warm, the tequila was very expensive! The carajillo was cheesy. The atmosphere was awful; the music was lacking in style, and it was too hot. We asked them to open the sunroof several times, but they didn't. And the service was lackluster. I never even knew who my server was. Finally, the chicken breast they made for my children tasted terrible; it's not kid-friendly, and there were plenty of them. The sauces were bland.

Firstly, the check-in process was smooth and efficient. The staff at the front desk were friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable. They provided all the necessary information about the hotel amenities and made me feel valued as a guest.

The room itself was spacious, clean, and well-appointed. The bed was comfortable, ensuring a good night's sleep after a long day of exploring the city. The bathroom was also spotless and stocked with high-quality toiletries.

One of the highlights of my stay was the hotel's dining options. The breakfast buffet offered a wide variety of delicious options, from fresh fruits and pastries to hot cooked dishes. In addition, they offered a free menu at the restaurant (soups, salads, sadwiches, snacks, soft drinks, frozen drinks and beer) The restaurant staff were attentive and accommodating, making sure that all guests were well taken care of.

The hotel's location was also ideal for exploring the city. It was conveniently located near popular attractions and public transportation options, making it easy to get around. Additionally, the hotel provided helpful recommendations for nearby restaurants and activities.

Last but not least, the service at this hotel was top-notch. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was enjoyable and hassle-free. From housekeeping to the concierge, everyone was professional, friendly, and always ready to assist with any requests or inquiries.

Overall, my 3-night stay at this hotel was truly excellent.

1555,"Hands Down Best Tacos In Colorado Springs

My wife and I have been going to Zocalo for the past 9 months and it has quickly become one of our favorite spots in the Springs.  We love the food and their drink menu is spectacular but I think the part we like most is the staff and owner.  Itâs rare, especially in todayâs day and age, to go to the same restaurant and see the same staff over a long period of time and I think the fact that we see the same familiar faces each time we go in speaks volumes to the atmosphere and the vibe going on there.  The staff and bartenders are friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable and the owner is so humble and easy going.

Going back to the food, my wife and I love street tacos and have been to just about every spot in the Springs and we both agree Zocalo is our favorite.  The El Macho and Quesabirria are my favorite and my wife, as a pescatarian, loves the fact that she has so many options there (her favorite is the Equites)â¦ and if youâre there on the weekend donât miss out on the Poke Nachos.  Their drink menu also has a lot of unique cocktails on it and we appreciate that all the drinks are made with real ingredients (no sour mix here).  The El Jefe and Mezcal Sour are great drinks but we find ourselves going back to the Mexican Blood and Sand more times than not.

I honestly canât say enough good things about this place, we initially went for the food and drink but find ourselves coming back over and over again for the vibe and the people.  Thereâs something special going on here and Iâm just happy to be a small part of it.","[0, 6, 7]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order"

The frozen margarita machine was broken which I was informed of 15 minutes after I ordered...90degrees out so that sucked and after waiting forever I was over it. Their was a wait for literally every little thing. The regular house margarita was eh. The food was good but a bit over priced. The staff was nice but very slow, especially the bartender. It was not very busy either. They don't ask you where you want to sit which is weird since that's part of why we came..and why have all that different seating and decor and not even ask? Especially since every section had tons of open seating...  we had to ask for a paper menu. People need to keep in mind not everyone's phone can scan qr codes and my dad's couldn't but he also can't read tiny print on his phone any way. Always offer menus. The qr fad needs to go away.

Iâve experienced in Mexico City yet. The food was delayed so much that my food got soggy and was not edible and did not eat it. Overall, we waited about an hour and 10 minutes to get our food and as we were eating, we were told that we had just a few minutes left To add any additional orders.

I recently visited Mexico City's Historic Center, and the experience was much more than a sightseeing tour: it was a journey through time and the many identities that coexist here. From the moment you arrive, it's impossible not to feel the weight of history and the vibrant energy that surrounds it.

This is where you'll find some of the country's most iconic sites, such as the ZÃ³calo, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the National Palace, and the Templo Mayor. Everything is close by and easy to explore on foot. Every corner has something to tell: stunning architecture, street art, traditional sounds like organ grinders, and the comings and goings of people that keep everything moving.

What surprised me most was the mix of old and new. You can see colonial buildings alongside modern shops, interactive museums, galleries, restaurants, and charming cafes. I highly recommend visiting the Palacio de Bellas Artes (both inside and out) and the Casa de los Azulejos. There are also many museums for those who enjoy art and history, such as the MUNAL (Mexican Museum of Art and History) and the Templo Mayor Museum.

The food is also excellent. From street vendors selling tacos, tlacoyos, and ice creams to places serving more elaborate traditional Mexican food, there are options for all budgets.

Of course, as in any urban center, you should be careful with your belongings and avoid lonely streets at night. Security has improved significantly, and there is police presence in the busiest areas, but it's always a good idea to proceed with caution.","[0, 6, 7, 14]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order, service, fast, delicious, food, good"

1653,"The Metropolitan Cathedral, a monumental presence in Mexico City's ZÃ³calo, is a breathtaking testament to centuries of architectural evolution and artistic devotion. Its faÃ§ade alone is a symphony of styles, a living chronicle etched in stone, spanning from the restrained austerity of its early Renaissance foundations to the exuberant flourish of its Baroque and Neoclassical embellishments. Twin bell towers pierce the sky, their intricate carvings and statuary reaching towards the heavens, while the central dome, a masterful feat of engineering, crowns the edifice with majestic grace.
Within, the grandeur continues. Soaring vaulted ceilings draw the eye upward, supported by massive columns that create a sense of profound scale. Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass windows, casts a kaleidoscope of colors across polished floors and gilded altarpieces, illuminating the rich tapestry of religious art. Every chapel, every corner, reveals meticulous craftsmanship: elaborate Churrigueresque retablos shimmering with gold leaf, delicate Rococo details whispering tales of devotion, and solemn Neoclassical forms exuding an air of dignified reverence. The sheer ambition, the fusion of diverse aesthetics, and the enduring quality of its construction make the Metropolitan Cathedral a truly awe-inspiring marvel of human ingenuity and spiritual expression.","[0, 14]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, service, fast, delicious, food, good"

1706,"Perfect meal and experience! We came for a 7:15 reservation and was able to be sat a bit before, which was perfect to see the sunset. I had the tepache and my girlfriend had the pornstar martini. We shared the blanco loco. The tepache was perfect- not too sweet and the mezcal smoky flavor held strong. The pornstar martini was nice, the maracuya flavor was prominent, but we wished there was more vanilla flavor. The blanco loco is sweet but delicious and an interesting texture.

We shared the four course menu and chose: the oysters, the crab taco, the beef mole and the chocolate cake. We were not very hungry so it was the perfect amount for the both of us. The oysters had many different textures which was interesting, but a bit overwhelming on the palette. I believe it contained miso glaze, but could not taste the umami flavor. The crab taco was lovely. A nice blend of textures (crunchy fried crab, onions and aioli) and flavors (avocado, lime and sweet crab). The star of the show was definitely the beef. Perfectly cooked, it tasted like butter and a wonderful mole sauce. The chicharrÃ³n balls and asparagus/brussel sprouts made for some interesting texture and flavor combinations. The chocolate cake dessert was light, creamy and buttery. Our waiter, Fabian, was very attentive and gave us great recommendations. When hearing of my girlfriendâs dairy allergy, they made sure to give us salsa with our bread instead of butter so she could enjoy.

We tried the cocktails Sandia, Loco Blanco, Godfather. All three were great.

The service was impeccableâattentive, friendly, without hovering. Everyone was pleasant. The view is unforgettable. Overlooking the ZÃ³calo at night is magical and adds an extra layer of charm to the whole experience.

I canât wait to come back to enjoy everything BalcÃ³n del ZÃ³calo has to offer again. Highly recommend it for a special evening out or just treating yourself to a fantastic meal and drinks!

1715,"Newer taco restaurant  on Tejon just north of Cimarron. The restaurant is big and has a nice relaxed atmosphere. I did not get to dine in, but sat at the bar while waiting for my order. I watch the bartenders make margaritas and they looked great, unfortunately, I had to drive home so didn't try any.  The menu has a large variety of tacos to choose from.  I ordered 6 different tacos to go (since it was my first time trying them, I wanted to sample as many as possible).  The tacos transported well and were quite tasty. I am sure eating them at the restaurant would have been a far better experience. I also ordered the churros.  They transported well, were still pretty warm with a nice chewy interior and a crispy exterior.  I will definitely be going back.","[6, 7]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order"
1716,"I was very disappointed from my experience. I have thought about my review for two months.

The initial complication started with the order to order a taco. I had questions. She didn't understand my simple questions about the ingredients of the specific tacos I was inquiring about (the vegetarian options). Ultimately, I wanted to know what the ingredients were and if it was free of animal products. My friend and I were able to decipher that she didn't know. When she came back to bring my friend's queso, and to take her order, I had a couple more questions about customizing my order. The server just couldn't comprehend. I tried four times to ask my questions. To restate my questions. Rephrase my questions and then I thought maybe I am not speaking well enough. So, my friend, who's a very articulate and great at projecting rephrased and reframe exactly what I was asking. No, there was not a a language barrier.

The request was to remove one ingredient from a taco. Or option 2, was was to apply the Portabella mushroom  mushroom to a different taco as the protein. It blew her mind. Following the conversation about customizing the taco I just gave up.  She went to go ask somebody in the kitchen. I don't even think she knew what she was asking. Even if she asked. While she was away, I asked my friend if I was not speaking clearly, or how I could've worded that more clearly and more understandable. She said, I think you were very clear.

The server returned. I wanted to make this a simple for everybody.  I will order the portobello taco with no cheese or creama. When the food arrived. Of course, there was creama on the taco. Yet the cheese was not present. Close, but still deadly. They remade the taco.

My incomprehensible request was the CAMOTE AL PASTOR taco with the Portabella mushroom added as a protein. That's all.

I ended up with the PANELA MUSHROOM, no cheese and creama.

While are they prepared our tacos, I noticed the water glass had red lipstick on it. As a result, I took a closer look. It was unwashed. Completely. Fingerprints and all. At this point I drank almost half of the water. Note, the server was very gracious, embarrassed and apologetic. They replaced my right away. Yes this can happen. It's disgusting. I'm not sure how it happened. At this point, I was really hopeful that the food redeem this place. Because the ambience was great, aside from the loud music.

When the mushroom taco arrived, it was simply a mushroom, with sauce, arugula on a tortilla. I asked for a side of avocado slices. She brings me smashed avocado, which they call guacamole. Which is OK. I just needed something to add flavor and a little more value to my taco. The flavor didn't change much. And I love avocado.

They did not charge me for the Avocado/guacamole due to the dirty water glass. That's very much appreciated. And I want to acknowledge that.

What's a taco good? No. Was it filling? No. It was lacking density and flavor. Also substance. I would love to have ordered more, but I was not going to even try based on the in accuracy and the lack of flavor or taste. I just left hungry.

My friend did enjoy her chips and queso. Her toco was ""okay"" as it lacked flavor. I don't recall which taco she ordered but it was an animal protein taco.

That taco isn't worth of five dollars. That taco isn't worth $1.50.

You will leave smelling like tacos. My coworkers new I had tacos for lunch. From two offices from away, he smelled me and my clothes. It's not a bad smell, but in a modern restaurant I don't think I should smell like a taco shop..

I do not recommend this place. I have no plans of going back. Many other people have had a very different experiences than I.

I don't understand, due to the computer in her hand, and from her knowledge, she could not request that the Portabella mushroom be added to a taco.  Perhaps the training gap. But also, you can add a note that says side of Portabella mushroom. Or place Portabella mushroom on this taco. No effort.","[6, 7]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order"

Pastor - best pastor I have ever had.

Chips and salsa(!) also did NOT disappoint, nor did the side of guac (though it seemed a little overpriced for the amount).

The quesabirria taco had almost no consume and did not have any meat in it... I heard the fried beef was really good but couldn't try it due to a gluten allergy. Most of the menu is gluten free which is awesome, but overall was underwhelmed by the food. Service was also a let down--our server was friendly but MIA most of the day.

We were excited to try BalcÃ³n del ZÃ³calo based on the views and the buzz online, but this turned out to be one of the worst dining experiences weâve had in Mexico City.

The space itself is beautiful, and the staff were friendly when we arrived, but unfortunately thatâs where the positives end. The food was a major letdown, and thatâs putting it lightly. Even for a group of adventurous eaters, the flavor combinations were strange and didnât work. A standout oddity: no real butter, just a strange coffee butter. But the real issue came with the steak.

One of our dishes came out completely raw, not rare or even medium-rare. raw. We sent it back immediately, and instead of correcting the issue, they simply removed the plateâ¦ and still charged us full price. No apology, no attempt to make it right.

To make matters worse, we had come specifically because we saw guacamole promoted online only to be told they didnât serve it anymore.

We even spoke with other diners who were equally disappointed with their meals.

Apparently they change their menu constantly and the one I got was not what attracted me to the place.
Average price per person from $1000 including the price of a drink.
Portions are small and few options.
I ordered a tlayuda with octopus carpaccio, as they said it was to share but no. It is for 1 person.
The only thing worth having about the place would be the view, you have to make a reservation if you want a table on the terrace.

I ordered the tasting menu. It took about 40 minutes to arrive and the delay between dish and dish was similar, 40 minutes, my drinks just took a while and took a while and well let's say that the food Mmmm, very average to be honest. Adding to how average the service is, I wouldn't return. They didn't make me feel special. They didn't give the level of recognition.

1943,"Constitution Square, also known as the ZÃ³calo, is an iconic location in the heart of Mexico City. With a rich history spanning from pre-Hispanic times to the present day, this plaza is a reflection of Mexican national identity.

*History and Significance*

- In pre-Hispanic times, the ZÃ³calo was part of the Templo Mayor, an important ceremonial center of the Aztecs.
- After the Spanish conquest, the Plaza Mayor was built, which became the political and religious center of the city.
- In 1813, it was officially named Plaza de la ConstituciÃ³n in honor of the Constitution of CÃ¡diz.
- The name ""ZÃ³calo"" comes from an unfinished project by Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna to build a monument to Independence in the center of the square. Only the base, or zÃ³calo, was placed, and it remained in place for years.

*Buildings and Monuments*

- *Metropolitan Cathedral*: one of the city's most important churches, built on the ruins of the Aztec Templo Mayor.
- *National Palace*: seat of the federal executive branch, built on the site of Moctezuma's palace.
- *Templo Mayor*: an archaeological site and museum housing the remains of the Aztec civilization.
- *City Hall*: seat of the Mexico City government.

*Current Issues*

- The presence of street vendors in the plaza is a controversial issue, as some believe it affects the aesthetics and functionality of the public space.

In short, the Plaza de la ConstituciÃ³n is an iconic place that reflects Mexico's rich history and culture. Although it faces current challenges, it remains an important political, religious, and cultural center of the city.","[0, 14]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, service, fast, delicious, food, good"

The manager, surnamed âLÃ³pezâ and a wall, serve to solve the same thing, nothing. Likewise the employee who made the reservation, Luis.

Sadly 13 of us will have to look for somewhere else.

No it doesnât it just allows scalpers to buy tickets and to sell them to 5 times the price through their websites cause they over buy the weekends and other days. I am the first advocate for buying and supporting local, but this is NOT! This system only benefits Booking Viator and other third parties. So, until they update that and allow for walk ins.

2013,"The Frida Kahlo Museum is one of those rare places that leaves you a little changed after visiting. It is not just a museum but the actual home where she lived, created, and endured her setbacks and triumphs. Walking through her rooms and seeing her studio with the brushes still at hand makes you feel as though she just stepped out for a moment. The experience is intimate and moving in a way that no traditional gallery can be because you are not only seeing her art, you are standing in the space where her life unfolded. The exhibits take you through her hardships and resilience, showing how every piece she created was born out of pain, strength, and an almost defiant creativity. The gardens are another highlight, lush and vibrant, a sanctuary that contrasts with the intensity of her story yet feels like a natural extension of her artistry. The tour is well done, guiding you through her world with just enough explanation to deepen the experience without overshadowing it. This is easily a five star cultural destination in Mexico City, worth every minute, and one of those places you carry with you long after leaving.","[7, 14]","food, service, bad, tacos, order, service, fast, delicious, food, good"

So they fill to the maximum. Of course, no exchange and no refund! We were left on the sidewalk without remorse like dogs because there were 2 police officers at the entrance to the museum, surely to calm the disappointed and angry latecomers like us!!!

The food here was the best we have had and great value.
We started with wine all from Mexico. Choices limited however we were happy with our choices. Next we had the salad with bacon and spiced nuts. Tacos we had the fish and octopus. Fish was better. Next steak and fish. The steak was perfectly cooked and the mustard sauce was a perfect compliment.  The fish was very good but the steak was better.  Lastly we had a slight communication lapse where I got the almond ice cream and cream cone and my daughter got the sorbet.  She is gluten free and we thought we ordered two sorbets but it was fine   We just did nit share that item.  They also brought gluten free crackers instead of bread.  Very accommodating.

It's certainly not a perfect cityâno city isâbut the magic of my city lies in the collision of antiquity with modernity. Quality of life and sustainable living, spectacular climate, and a historic center carved by Mexicans, hundreds of beautiful buildings that, like silent witnesses, have stood before the entire conquest and colonial era of our country. That energy is perceived, felt, and moves me. I am proudly from Puebla. There are undoubtedly shortcomings, but Puebla has a big heart and a mystical energy. Everyone is welcome. Walk around the main square and the surrounding area, eat a lot, take photos, visit the museums and wonders of the world, enjoy the weather, contemplate the volcanoes, enjoy the culture and avant-garde.

She had polio in her childhood and then she had a tragic accident while riding a school bus when a tram crashed into her. She suffered multiple fractures in her hip and spine. She was bedridden for a long time while she recovered from her injuries. She was in constant pain but she had an indomitable spirit to live. She taught herself to paint, initially inspired by her husband and later on her own. She gained recognition worldwide. The pain she endured while she was alive comes through in some of her works.

We visited in late August and found the crowd to be moderate. We didn't have to wait in any excessively long lines, and the staff was friendly and efficient, making the whole process easy to navigate. The accessibility is a big plus, and there is plenty of parking available in the area, which takes a lot of stress out of the visit.
From the top, you get a breathtaking panoramic view of the city, Lake Ontario, and beyond. The glass floor is a thrilling experience and a great photo opportunity.

The flautas are well-browned, but very dry, lacking visual appeal, and the bite is also unenjoyable. The salsa is served in a small plastic bottle, not in proper containers.

2193,"The first 3 to 5 times I ordered, it was tasty, an adequate portion, neither too little nor too much, at a good price, and carefully served.
Now, sometimes I keep ordering, not because I like it or love it, but because it's the least bad.
Also, I don't know if it happens to you, but the more times I order, the more ugly and sloppy they send me. It seems that instead of feeling flattered and committed, it makes them angry that I keep ordering.
The Tupperware arrives stained with marks or fingerprints from cream, salsa, etc. The portions are smaller and more expensive. When I order two pozoles, they send the condiments (lettuce, lemons, onion, etc.) only for one pozole, and once they didn't send anything, just the pozole and tostadas for one. If they don't have them anymore, at least let us know so we know if we still want it or not, or cancel the order promptly.
I really liked ordering chilaquiles with steak, but I stopped ordering them because they were more like skin than meatâpractically skin or tough meat, if you will.
I find the quesadillas very expensive for how small they are.
The flautas sometimes come with a decent portion of chicken and other times with a rough portion.
It's worth mentioning that their menu is practically all tortillas (chilaquiles, enchiladas, flautas, quesadillas, sopes) with decent chicken, but I don't recommend them with steak.
Finally, they raised the prices and reduced the portions.
The tinga (pork) by the gram doesn't say what kind of meat it is; I think it's pork, but they don't mention it, even though they include government-mandated inscriptions, the ingredients are unclear, and their flavor is average, acceptable.
In short, sometimes I keep ordering them, not because I like them or love them, but because they're the least bad.","[7, 10]","food, service, bad, tacos, order, pretty, negative, cdmx, delivery, positive"

I had a large red pozole with chicken ($99), and it was served fast and hot, with a generous amount of chicken. However, I highly recommend some lime and a little powdered red pepper. That took the dish from a 3 to a 4.5. There are a ton of servers working there, so just get someone's attention and you will get what you need fast.

Drinks have skyrocketed in price, and the takeout service is terrible (they send you a packet of salsa and if you want more, they charge you for it, haha). For the pozole, they sent three lettuce leaves, no lemons, and no additional seasoning, even though we didn't ask for it.

La Casa de ToÃ±o, and the AragÃ³n branch in particular, is for me the ultimate place for Mexican antojitos. They've achieved something incredible: bringing the experience of a traditional neighborhood pozoleria to a chain model without sacrificing flavor.

What I love:

The food is a 10/10: The pozole is consistently delicious, with an authentic, comforting flavor. The rest of the antojitos are simply exquisite. They never disappoint.

The Customer Experience: The service is excellent. Their system is so efficient that from the moment you arrive until you leave, everything flows seamlessly. They are fast, attentive, and never fail to deliver.

An important observation:

The Staff's Work Rate: As a customer, I enjoy impeccable service. However, I can't help but notice the immense pressure the team seems to be working under. The waiters and captains move at a breakneck pace without stopping. While this results in amazing efficiency, it leaves me feeling like a lot is being demanded of them. It's a recognition of the enormous effort they put in.

2463,"So, I've been stewing on this since Saturday when we went to The R.O.M. for the first time. We (myself, my husband, our adult kids  with one spouse and our granddaughter)  drove almost 3 hours specifically to see the Auschwitz exhibit. Something that is near to my heart because my Nana was a Polish slave during WWII .
We continously checked the website on our way there to make sure time slots were available and at no time did it give any indication the time slots were getting full.
We arrived shortly before 1 p.m. and were advised all time slots were full except 3:40 p.m. .
The person who was helping us purchase tickets for that slot also told us there were only 2 available for that time. But, advised us it was OK. There would be no problem having 4 extra people. He also advised us our best bet was to buy the tickets that allowed us into the other exhibit, the Flemish 300 years of art exhibit.  Assuring us we would have time for both.
We proceeded to buy those tickets to the tune of almost 200 dollars.
He advised us to browse the other areas of the museum (several areas blocked off due to exhibit updates etc). We enjoyed what we were able to see and approximately 30 mins before our alloted time to visit the Auschwitz exhibit made our way back to the elevators to go to that floor.
We were met with a mess. People crowded into the area by the elevators. No one knew where to be. Workers blocking the elevators saying we were unable to go up yet and virtually everyone saying they had tickets for 3:40.
Eventually we were corralled into a line and stood in that line well beyond our alloted time ( 4:40 before we even made it to the elevator. All the while being offered tickets to come another day because *we didn't expect so many people* by museum staff wandering through the line. Interestingly enough we were encouraged to complain to management by these same  staff members.
When we finally got to the entrance of the display it was beyond hot. People were crammed into a small area to wait to get beyond the waiting area.
Once inside there was very little time to actually look at anything before people were being herded in behind us. We spent most of our time waiting for the crowd ahead of us to move forward.
The displays were sparse and consisted mostly of pictures with a few artifacts .
3/4 of the way through the loudspeaker began announcing the museum was closed. Loudly enough that any information being given on the headsets was drowned out.
So, not only were we unable to take a reasonable amount of time to view this important historical information we were unable to even go to the other exhibit we paid to see.
They did refund our money. They also gave us tickets to see the display we missed out on but after the disorganized mess we were shuttled through,  I hesitate to even attempt the journey.
I have honestly seen better displays and organization at little roadside museums in off the beaten track towns.
So disappointing.
I wanted so very much to love this museum and the exhibit we came specifically to see but definitely did not.
What should have been a journey to see what our Nana lived through left us just hot,  sweaty and not even a little more educated than we were when we arrived.","[6, 7]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order"

It is shameful to gatekeep such an important part of history and should instead be made as accessible as possible to all who are interesting in learning about it, not locked behind an extra ticket tier for more profit.

During our visit it was not even possible to buy another ticket as it was sold out for the day. Awareness of such important (and rightly advertised as ânot so long agoâ by the museum itself) pieces of history should never be for profit.","[6, 10]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, pretty, negative, cdmx, delivery, positive"
2521,"The experience at the Royal Ontario Museum was very good. The collections are fascinating. The best one of all was the dinosaurs one. A couple of opportunities for improvement: 4th. Floor Exhibition had no washrooms. Also, the benches or sitting spaces all across the museum are extremely limited, which can be challenging as you may want to take a little break from time to time. You are allowed to bring your lunch, but the only place to leave your cooler is in the coat check area (for a fee). You are able to re-enter the museum the same day, so we decided to go to McDonald's for lunch, which was 2 mins. away walking. There is paid parking very close by.

If, after that wait, the food doesn't live up to expectations, it can be somewhat disappointing.

When I finally entered, the exhibition was overcrowded and moved very slowly. I donât mind that many people are there, but the flow was so poorly managed that it became impossible to enjoy. At 5:30 pm, the museum announced it was closing, even though I hadnât even made it through half of the exhibition.
It makes no sense to sell tickets with a 4:00 pm entry time if visitors are not given enough time to experience the entire exhibition!!This completely spoiled my day, and I left feeling frustrated and disappointed, especially since it is 90$ entrance fee for 2 adults.","[6, 10]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, pretty, negative, cdmx, delivery, positive"

2676,"Saturday, May 31, 3:30 p.m. We visited the Casa ToÃ±o branch located on DÃ­az MirÃ³n, in the Miguel Hidalgo borough. Unlike other branches, this one tends to be less busy, so the wait time was minimal.

As with all Casa ToÃ±o restaurants, the food is good and affordable. That day we tried:
â¢ Steak tacos: very tasty and generous portions for the price.
â¢ Minced pork tostadas: hearty and delicious.
â¢ Potato and cheese quesadilla: highly recommended.
â¢ Dessert: coffee with vanilla concha, also quite good.

The advantages of this place are clear: speed, flavor, and price. You'll rarely find anything negative, although it's true that the dishes are delicious without being extraordinary.

In short: Casa ToÃ±o is a highly recommended place for any time of day, whether breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Delicious, fast, and affordable foodâa formula that's hard to fail.","[6, 11]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, excellent, service, place, attention, station"

For dessert I highly recommend the flan de cajeta de la abuela and for drinks there is a great variety from aguas frescas, soft drinks to beers. I recommend the place because the service is quite fast, maybe at the reception you can wait up to 10 minutes but once you are inside the service is fast, so I suggest by education in Mexico leave at least 10% tip as a basis, this varies depending on the service you receive from the waiters.

I received a tracking link through Uber, but when the delivery driver left I noticed that they sent the order to the wrong address. I contacted the delivery person, but he told me that he could not change the address and that I had to deliver it as is. If I cannot deliver it, I would return it to the restaurant.

I immediately contacted La Casa de ToÃ±o's WhatsApp service. After much insistence, they told me that I would have to personally go to the branch for the order, that they would only keep it for an hour and that, if I didn't go, they would throw it away. They rejected any type of refund or solution, arguing that this is what their terms and conditions indicate.

The unfair thing is that I did correctly provide my location and address, which was confirmed by them, therefore the ""wrong address"" policy does not apply. The most disappointing thing was the lack of empathy, real care and solutions. I also called customer service and they told me that they could only assist me through WhatsApp, to repeat the same thing: ""There are no refunds or resends.""

I recommend being very careful when placing orders via WhatsApp with La Casa de ToÃ±o. Their system has flaws, their service is slow, and in the event of an error they are not responsible, even if the error was theirs.

My son has low muscle tone, developmental delays, and is autistic. Upon arrival, we were told to check in our wagon and were offered a stroller as an alternative. Unfortunately, the stroller provided was undersized, causing his feet to drag on the ground. This discomfort triggered sensory issues, prompting him to remove his shoes repeatedly throughout the visit.

We rely on a wagon during outings to carry his essentials such as diapers and water, and to provide a sense of comfort and security. Additionally, it helps reduce the uncomfortable attention he sometimes receives when using a stroller due to his age and size.

Update: The management team's professionalism is depicted through blocking
my email. How entertain is this? ð

----------------------------------
If you go, you may face unfair and discriminatory treatment that undermines basic human rights. The CN Tower will make you wait in unbelievably long linesâup to 30min to 1hr.

On Wednesday, August 6, when there was a shortage of two tickets, I politely requested access to camera footage to help clarify the issue. Instead of helping me to solve the problem, the CN's representative, Ms.Nessari, falsely accused me of being an unsafe person, and then of course I didn't get my two tickets back

I contacted the CN Towerâs team to raise my concerns and express my opinion.
I got accused. This is a violation of my freedom of expression and an act of discrimination against me as a human being!","[7, 14]","food, service, bad, tacos, order, service, fast, delicious, food, good"
3092,"Beautiful view from this tower! It's a tourist attraction in Toronto. I booked tickets on their website a few days before leaving because I didn't know if we could get seats. It's not necessary, there are ticket sales at the bottom of the tower. You can eat at the top of the tower; the prices are high, so go eat nearby. No waiting if you have tickets. The line may seem long, but it goes very quickly.",[7],"food, service, bad, tacos, order"
3093,"We visited the CN tower yesterday. Despite not booking ahead, we barely queued to buy our tickets and then go up to the top. Note that we went up towards the end of the afternoon to catch the sunset. Which we did! The different viewpoints are worth it. However, at the beginning of the visit, the Tower staff takes pictures of the visitors as souvenir. We were very surprised to discover at the end of our visit that the pictures were already printed, but that they costed $45 + taxes. If you donât buy them, they get shredded. What a waste of resources! We didnât buy them because of the outrageous price (equivalent to a one-person ticket up the tower). It was very disappointing to end on this note - and to know our smily pictures were about to be shredded.","[6, 7]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order"

3095,"The food is acceptable, but the pozole is their strong point, it could use a little more seasoning. The portion of pozole in their small sizes is more the cost than the size. They could improve, but I don't think they want to. You go to the lady on the corner who sells pozole, and it's definitely better than here. Their service is good, but it gets annoying that every minute someone asks you if you need or want anything else. Keep the interruptions down; it doesn't let you eat or chat comfortably. Just be on the lookout for someone to call you; that's why they have the buzzer on the table, right? Oh! And please, if there are a lot of empty tables and no one around, don't bother us so we can leave as soon as possible. Besides eating, if someone is with someone, we like to chat, okay?

3128,"Auschwitz Exhibit:
This exhibit was fascinating, thorough, and well thought out. The audio device with headphones was fabulous. The artifacts were thoughtfully chosen, with detailed information about them. The replicas/ and or the actual artifacts were perfectly preserved. The videos/audio gave a lot of life to the exhibit and really demonstrated what happened in Auschwitz to its victims. I especially loved the probably lesser known people, i.e. the carpenter who made a box for the SS after his skills were discovered. I did find the exhibits/displays a bit confusing. It was hard to figure out where to start in each room after the big red signs introducing each room. Before you go, you need to read up on the camps/WW2. I think it would be confusing if you did not know what happened. I don't think it is a place for children-only because of the density of the content. There is a lot of reading, listening, and watching. I spent 3 hours there and I don't think the parents/ adults with kids would get the same kind of experience. Also, the parents/ adults would get distracted with the kids and not focus on the exhibit. What I really found interesting was the silence.....everyone had their headphones on and even in between the audio excerpts, people were quiet. It was a respectful environment and conducive to learning. I do wish there was someone at the end I could have asked questions. It is well worth the trip and the cost.","[0, 6]","good, beautiful, place, eat, service, nice, great, amazing, place, food"

3131,"I recently had the chance to visit the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM), and it was a truly memorable experience. The museum is massive and beautifully designed, with an impressive infrastructure that immediately captures your attention.
Even though I had only about an hour to explore (as the museum closes at 5:30 PM on Sundays), I was able to see a wide variety of fascinating exhibits. From historical artifacts to species displays, crystals, diaspores, and cultural history exhibits, there was so much to take in. The museum does a great job of curating items from different time periods and parts of the world, offering a rich blend of natural history, art, and culture.
One hour was definitely not enough to explore everything thoroughlyâthis is the kind of place you could easily spend half a day in if you're someone who enjoys history, science, and art. Iâd highly recommend arriving earlier in the day to make the most of your visit.
Whether you're a tourist or a local, the ROM is absolutely worth visiting at least once.

Excited to share about the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) in Toronto! ð¨ð¦

This is a special moment in my journey of exploring the worldâs history and culture.

Founded in 1914, the Royal Ontario Museum is one of North Americaâs largest museums, dedicated to natural history, world cultures, and art. Over the decades, ROM has become a hub for learning, research, and global heritage, attracting millions of visitors every year. Its Michael Lee-Chin Crystal, a modern architectural addition, beautifully blends contemporary design with historical elegance.

From the Australian art galleries that inspired creativity,
to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial that taught reflection and hope,
and the Auckland War Museum that honored bravery and history,
each visit has enriched my perspective.

Now, ROM adds a Canadian chapter with its amazing artifacts, dinosaur skeletons, and world cultures. Its treasures and iconic architecture make it a must-visit for anyone passionate about history and art.

Every museum I visit connects me more deeply to human creativity, resilience, and heritage.

Canât wait to explore and learn more!",[14],"service, fast, delicious, food, good"

I had no doubt that it was the food from ToÃ±o's house, because I had ordered it for breakfast and I started to feel bad shortly. Be careful with this food. Only at your risk.
It should be noted that it is very rare for me to get sick to my stomach and I am not particularly fond of eating on the street or in a restaurant, so I don't want to imagine what the food was like or where it came from.","[6, 7, 8, 10]","nice, great, amazing, place, food, food, service, bad, tacos, order, place, wonderful, visit, castle, great, pretty, negative, cdmx, delivery, positive"

Not shocking, not a presentation that one would feel bad.  Don't like using the word other than toned down.  Lacking shock value.  The current generation should be told the truth and not something that is so very much watered down.  I felt even some academic censorship of the subject was presented.  Sad to see.  Would not recommend any other institution use this exhibit that is far, far too tame.  Did not give any sense of the horror of this location or of the events.  Where were the photos or films of corpses and bodies discovered by the Russian army?  None of this was presented and should have been at the very least.",[6],"nice, great, amazing, place, food"

And at the end of the day when we were leaving, she again was there to say goodbye and we had a good chuckle at my experience, but she definitely made my day better. The museum itself is fantastic.
