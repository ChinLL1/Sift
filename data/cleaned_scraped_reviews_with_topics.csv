I chose this hotel because of a very positive previous experience years before. If anything, Hotel Zocalo Central was even better than the last time. It‚Äôs a beautiful property a short walk from Plaza Central and a pedestrian mall lined with shops, restaurants, parks and museums. But it‚Äôs the staff that makes this hotel great. Here is an example. I had always wanted to see Lucha Libre, a colorful, dramatic and acrobatic Mexican version of WWE entertainment wrestling in the US. Emblematic of this Mexican form of wrestling, the Luchadores (wrestlers) wear colorful snug-fitting masks called mascaras. I asked at the desk, and they sent me to Leyka, the concierge. My last chance to attend Lucha Libre before we went home was at Arena Mexico the next evening. It was complicated to acquire a ticket and find a good seat at the last minute. Leyka took over and tracked down a ticket only five rows from ringside. I was so excited. The next day I stopped by to thank Leyka and she presented me with my own mascara de Luchador. It was as colorful and well-made as the ones worn by the Luchadores in the ring. That night I had such a great time. The pageantry of Lucha Libre features a Good vs Evil theme. The observers are very much involved in what's going on in the ring, and the arena throbbed with the passionate crowd.

"Historic center of Mexico City, Centro, Cuauht√©moc, 06000 Mexico City, Mexico","love, recommended, highly, expensive, fine, pozole, recommend, everything, great, place","On a college trip to Mexico City with Canisius, I visited the heart of the city‚Äîthe Z√≥calo, which is the modern-day name for the main square. The experience was incredible, especially learning how this bustling plaza sits atop the ruins of the ancient city of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. This space, which today is surrounded by the grandeur of colonial-era architecture and governmental buildings, once housed the very center of the Aztec world. It‚Äôs a living testament to Mexico‚Äôs layered history.

As I stood in the square, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel the weight of what was beneath my feet. Tenochtitlan, which was founded in 1325, was one of the largest cities in the world at its height, sitting on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco. The Aztecs engineered a sophisticated city with floating gardens (chinampas) and canals that rivaled those of Venice. The location of the Z√≥calo itself was the site of Templo Mayor, a grand temple dedicated to the gods Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc. Although the Spaniards destroyed much of it during their conquest in 1521, you can still see remnants of the temple through archaeological excavations, which are visible right off the square.

The energy of the Z√≥calo is palpable‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs the musicians playing traditional tunes, the street vendors selling indigenous crafts, or the vibrant political protests that sometimes fill the space. It‚Äôs one of those places where the past and present seem to coexist so naturally. The knowledge that Tenochtitlan was a thriving metropolis, built with precision and spiritual significance, made me appreciate the enduring influence of Aztec culture on modern-day Mexico.

Walking through the nearby Museo del Templo Mayor and seeing artifacts, such as stone carvings, sculptures, and sacrificial altars, brought this history to life even more. I remember staring at a giant stone disc depicting Coyolxauhqui, the goddess dismembered by her brother Huitzilopochtli, in awe of how the Aztecs used art to tell their powerful myths.

Visiting the Z√≥calo and understanding that it sits on the bones of Tenochtitlan, I realized how much of history can remain hidden beneath the surface‚Äîboth literally and figuratively. It was a profound experience that made me rethink how I view urban spaces, as every stone and structure seemed to have a story waiting to be uncovered. It‚Äôs a reminder that cities are built on the legacies of civilizations past, and the Z√≥calo is one of the best places to see those layers right in front of you.",370,Subway station,,,,,Subway station,Zack Schneider,2024-10-22T20:51:29.911Z,,,college trip mexico city canisius visited heart citythe zcalo modernday name main square experience incredible especially learning bustling plaza sits atop ruins ancient city tenochtitlan capital aztec empire space today surrounded grandeur colonialera architecture governmental buildings housed center aztec world living testament mexicos layered history stood square couldnt help feel weight beneath feet tenochtitlan founded one largest cities world height sitting island middle lake texcoco aztecs engineered sophisticated city floating gardens chinampas canals rivaled venice location zcalo site templo mayor grand temple dedicated gods huitzilopochtli tlaloc although spaniards destroyed much conquest still see remnants temple archaeological excavations visible right square energy zcalo palpablewhether musicians playing traditional tunes street vendors selling indigenous crafts vibrant political protests sometimes fill space one places past present seem coexist naturally knowledge tenochtitlan thriving metropolis built precision spiritual significance made appreciate enduring influence aztec culture modernday mexico walking nearby museo del templo mayor seeing artifacts stone carvings sculptures sacrificial altars brought history life even remember staring giant stone disc depicting coyolxauhqui goddess dismembered brother huitzilopochtli awe aztecs used art tell powerful myths visiting zcalo understanding sits bones tenochtitlan realized much history remain hidden beneath surfaceboth literally figuratively profound experience made rethink view urban spaces every stone structure seemed story waiting uncovered reminder cities built legacies civilizations past zcalo one best places see layers right front,1

Ricardo greeted us as we walked in and out each day. When we checked into the hotel it was lovely to be able to go down to the 24 Hr cafe and grab something to eat instead of having to search for food on our first day. The wraps, salads and soup were really delicious. I loved sitting on the balcony each morning for breakfast. Breakfast was pretty much the same thing each morning. Fabian was our waiter the whole visit and he was awesome. Loved the complimentary bottle of wine and the walking tour with Daniella. She was very informative, did not rush us and professional. My only complaint is the shower. The shower head is placed too high. I am short and my sister who is a little taller than me both stated it was hard to position the shower head without getting it all in face and hair.

We initially made a reservation through Booking.com, and it was a pre-established price (US$944.08). We even thought the amount had been charged to our card. However, I was surprised when I arrived at the hotel and was told that the reservation was only a pre-reservation and that I would have to pay the fees in the hotel lobby. The hotel attendant's attitude was extremely rude and impatient, as if we were the ones in the wrong. Not to mention that the ""pre-reservation"" price was not applied, and we paid a much higher amount than the amount stated at the time of booking. Since this initial attitude didn't seem like a mistake, but rather a dynamic, we checked the room rates on the day we checked in. The same room for the same number of days was US$835.00, while we had to pay US$1,558.07. We were extremely upset after the incident, but since there was no time to look for another place, we agreed to stay. In any case, the least a real hotel could do is refund the overcharged amount as quickly as possible.",583,Hotel,,,,,Hotel,Rafael,2025-06-22T21:05:49.682Z,en,,foreigners careful initially made reservation bookingcom preestablished price us even thought amount charged card however surprised arrived hotel told reservation prereservation would pay fees hotel lobby hotel attendants attitude extremely rude impatient ones wrong mention prereservation price applied paid much higher amount amount stated time booking since initial attitude didnt seem like mistake rather dynamic checked room rates day checked room number days us pay us extremely upset incident since time look another place agreed stay case least real hotel could refund overcharged amount quickly possible,7

Its Baroque and Neoclassical design dates back to the Viceroyalty of New Spain, when the viceroys used to frequent Chapultepec to stroll and rest.
In 1840, the Heroic Military College established its headquarters in the castle. It also played a significant role in the Battle of Chapultepec as part of the American intervention in Mexico.
During the imperial transition, Maximilian of Habsburg and Charlotte lived in this castle, captivated by the beautiful views of the Valley of Mexico.
The castle also served as the presidential residence for most of the Mexican Revolution and until 1938.
A decree was issued requesting that the castle be used as the headquarters of the National Museum of History, and it opened its doors to the public for the first time on September 27, 1944.
Chapultepec Castle is the only castle in Latin America to have served as the official residence of a monarch.
It is open Tuesday through Sunday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
General admission is 100 pesos and is free for children under 13, adults over 60, people with disabilities, and students and teachers with a valid ID.

"418 S Tejon St suite 100, Colorado Springs, CO 80903","food, service, bad, tacos, order, dont, even, like, time, good","We visited this restaurant on a Friday night, catching the tail end of their busy hour. The host greeted us and mentioned a 20-minute wait, jotting our name and number on a piece of paper. Interestingly, other guests and reservations appeared to be managed through a tablet system, so it felt a bit disorganized from the start.

We waited outside and noticed several larger parties being seated ahead of us. Assuming they had reservations, we waited patiently. However, after a while, we decided to check in‚Äîonly to realize that the hostess had clearly forgotten us. She seated us shortly after.

Our server was polite but seemed to lack proper training. She took our appetizer and drink orders together, then returned with drinks and took our dinner order. We received our entr√©es, but had to remind her about the appetizers, which arrived late. One of the meals came out incorrectly, but to her credit, she did correct it fairly quickly.

When it came time to pay, confusion set in. We had clipped our cards to the respective tabs, but the charges appeared to be mixed up. To avoid further complications, we covered the difference between ourselves. Later, we discovered that one card was charged twice, instead of charging the two separate cards provided.

As for the food‚Äîit was underwhelming.

Overall, the experience was more frustrating than enjoyable.",1021,Mexican restaurant,Cocktail bar,Taco restaurant,,,Mexican restaurant,Lisa Byom,2025-05-20T03:10:19.027Z,,,visited restaurant friday night catching tail end busy hour host greeted us mentioned minute wait jotting name number piece paper interestingly guests reservations appeared managed tablet system felt bit disorganized start waited outside noticed several larger parties seated ahead us assuming reservations waited patiently however decided check inonly realize hostess clearly forgotten us seated us shortly server polite seemed lack proper training took appetizer drink orders together returned drinks took dinner order received entres remind appetizers arrived late one meals came incorrectly credit correct fairly quickly came time pay confusion set clipped cards respective tabs charges appeared mixed avoid complications covered difference later discovered one card charged twice instead charging two separate cards provided foodit underwhelming overall experience frustrating enjoyable,7

Our server was decent at first, but once he realized the tip was automatically included, we barely saw him again; meanwhile, the smaller tables got the real attention. My plate honestly felt a little sad because the chicken was dry and lacked flavor. Also, for a brunch spot, not offering coffee is just wild to me.

The atmosphere and aesthetic were actually really nice, the space is bright and well put together, and the swings are a fun touch that definitely add to the vibe. But that only goes so far.

A $16+ breakfast burrito feels like a stretch. I know prices are up, but breakfast should be more accessible, not a luxury. Drinks were okay. I also tried the lobster quesadilla, and while it sounded fancy, it barely had any lobster despite the price.

In essence, the catacomb / crypt tour is only on Fridays from 11am to ~4pm. I forget how much admission was, but it was pretty cheap (~$5 USD). You can only buy tickets in person from a guide posted in front of the middle chamber of the church; cash only.

The tour is ONLY in Spanish. You will see one or two side chambers of the church, then the middle chamber with the giant organs (some or the largest in North America), then descend steps from there down to the crypts.

It has a lot of interesting artifacts, paintings and excellent views of the city and the angel.  The architecture of the castle is amazing.  I appreciate that there is an elevator, since we have a handicap person with us.  I must warn you that the hike up to the castle is quite long and I saw a few people nearly passing out.  But I think that if you are moderately active, the hike might be difficult but not impossible.  Beware of the food vendors in the food section. We ordered chicken and broth and were charged 90 pesos, for a very small bowl.  That was 20 pesos more than what I paid for a huarache with sudadero, which was larger and with more meat.  This was at the section with the blue umbrellas.  Our server forgot our order, when he finally brought it it was incomplete.  The chicken broth was not on the menu, so we didn't know the price.  It was my mistake for not asking the price before hand.  When I question him about the excessive cost, he said it was because it must of had a lot of chicken.  With prices in Mexico they would have to use half a chicken to justify the price.  Other than that insident, our trip was great.  You need the whole day to be able to explore more of Chapultepec.

As mentioned the housekeeping is a disappointment. We left the room every morning and back around 4 with the clean room sign hanging at the door. The room was not cleaned and untouched. We had to ask them to come and clean them again around 5. I understand that was the busiest time of the year but not cleaning your room for such a long time. Guests just want a clean room to rest after a long day out

The gym is very small as people mentioned. The absurd thing is you cannot go to the gym on the first floor with your key card. You need to go to the reception and ask them to get you to the 1/f

The hotel is stylish and I like it
We also like the concept they give free drinks but the coffee is bad. It is coffee water not coffee .. I don‚Äôt know how

The location is a plus and minus. The plus side is you can easily access to the busiest area of the city and zocalo for sights and experience

The minus was since it was around Christmas time most of the time cars cannot get close to the hotel. The first time we came by taxi it took us triple the time and the taxi could not get into the hotel with all roads blocked
For the next coming days we could not get taxi right at the the hotel or dropping off at the spot
You simply need to walk 5 mins away from the busiest area to get the transportation

Other than these problems I would recommend to stay there but not during Christmas or festival times",1185,Hotel,,,,,Hotel,wanson luk,2025-01-09T16:46:39.460Z,,,struggling give thinking housekeeping give mentioned housekeeping disappointment left room every morning back around clean room sign hanging door room cleaned untouched ask come clean around understand busiest time year cleaning room long time guests want clean room rest long day gym small people mentioned absurd thing cannot go gym first floor key card need go reception ask get f hotel stylish like also like concept give free drinks coffee bad coffee water coffee dont know location plus minus plus side easily access busiest area city zocalo sights experience minus since around christmas time time cars cannot get close hotel first time came taxi took us triple time taxi could get hotel roads blocked next coming days could get taxi right hotel dropping spot simply need walk mins away busiest area get transportation problems would recommend stay christmas festival times,7

I know they think they are giving away the food because it is included with the hotel reservation, which is not a cheap rate. Now in the suite we stayed in, we returned around 8pm and the bathroom was leaking water from the ceiling, they sent someone to fix it, which is fine, but they didn't give us another bedroom option and afterward they didn't talk to us to see if everything was okay, they didn't take much notice of it.

This is more of an upscale place with high end food choices and pricey drinks.  For two, we had the 4 course option, 3 drinks and glass of wine, was about 250.00 dollars.  To put that in perspective the day before for a group of 8, I spent about the same amount at cafe Tacuba.  That being said the atmosphere is great you will feel and know you are in a high end place, the minute you step off the elevator.   There will be no confusion, that you will be paying more for your meal than some Mexicans makes in almost a month (I Googled that info). As for the service it was on point. After each meal, my fork was replaced with a clean fork.  Also the views, at night from the balcony facing the Cathedral are amazing.  As for the food it was good, but I personally cannot justify the price to the portions.  If you are a regular sized guy you will, leave hungry I am 6,2 at 250 and was ready to go get me some street tacos afterward.  But of course for the ladies they were perfect portion size.

Started with the Chips & Salsa. Fresh crispy chips fresh out the fryer and very tasty salsa with a good kick. I tried several of their tacos and they were all great. Tacos I tried: Panela Mushroom, Steak Chimichurri, El Macho, Quesabirria, and Eaquites. To wet my taste buds, I had the Ancho Old Fashion. And it was delicious.

"418 S Tejon St suite 100, Colorado Springs, CO 80903","food, service, bad, tacos, order, dont, even, like, time, good","Update 5 months later : Completely unprofessional and inappropriate sanitary standards.

Staff is serving while munching on their snacks. It's super unsanitary. And who wants a server talking to you while they're still chewing their food? Or putting the lime in their Corona, when they haven't washed their hands and just munched on chips and salsa.

The staff seemed largely distracted by consuming their own snacks/ meals any chance they got. Even my date questioned from the moment we walked in, ""why is the staff eating/ chewing"" he thought they were having a staff party or get together.

The chicken quesadilla we had (and had previously on a separate visit) was not as good as the previous time and served with no salsas. The Chili Rellanos were mediocre.

The entire visit was such a turn off due to the staff eating and not washing their hands.

We did speak to the manager and I expressed my concerns and even emailed the owners. This is unacceptable.

I don't recommend.

Initial review: Spunky, Delicious. NOISY.

- review based off of 2 visits 2 days apart.

a fun spot with tasty food. Only complaints the noise, and inconsistency in hours posted on the doors.

Really not cool guys- for the customers or your employees. If you close at 10- UPDATE THE DOORS.

SO HOURS ARE NOT TRUSTWORTHY!!!

You basically have to yell at the person next to you because of the music being so loud and all the other people yelling to talk.

Other than that.  Great food except for the guacamole appetizer which was bland, granted we ordered the mango and tajin on the side.

They accommodated our request for a chicken quesadilla *ZOCALO*- add it to the menu, it was one of the best chicken quesadillas! Thank you for accommodating our request.

Drinks, especially the margaritas are STRONG.

The swings look like fun and since I will return to enjoy a seat on the swings, I suppose I‚Äôd recommend them.

My first visit was no more than a couple of months ago and I've visited probably 10 times since. I waited until today to write a review because I was looking for some reason to temper all this praise with at least one thing I found them lacking in, because nothing is perfect.... But Zocalo is reliably perfect. So shout out to manager Ashley, because though we haven't met, you're obviously doing things right.

I've tried several of the street tacos here and I love them all, but el pastor is #1. I've searched high and low for pastor in the Springs only to be disappointed. Zocalo is so far above the rest, it's ridiculous.

And in the kitchen, it delivered.
The Lentil Soup was a warm, profound start, with flavors that seemed to come from a kitchen steeped in history. The beef fillet sope, small but powerful, struck a perfect balance between traditional and refined. The Totoaba Loin‚Äîsimply sublime‚Äîcooked to the point of perfection. And the chocolate cheesecake, elegant without being pretentious, rounded out with a wine pairing that complemented it without stealing the show. It was, without exaggeration, a first-class execution. Cuisine that walks firmly down the runway of the memorable.

But then, the service.
There, the narrative changed. Long silences. Gazes searching for someone who hadn't come. Dishes that never arrived, but were still charged for. A service pace so rushed that you doubted whether you were dining or racing against the clock. And the final irony: after the last bite, we were asked to leave a review.

So here it is:
A cuisine with vision and technique, the kind you'd recommend without a second thought. But marred by service that seemed improvised, as if a museum painting had been hung with thumbtacks.

In a place where the cuisine is top-notch, the service can't afford to be grounded. Because when you dine at the Balc√≥n del Z√≥calo, you don't just expect a meal. You expect an experience.

The Metropolitan Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven in Mexico City stands as one of the most emblematic and majestic monuments in Latin America, dominating the north side of the Z√≥calo or Plaza de la Constituci√≥n in the heart of Mexico City's Historic Center.
History and Construction
The history of this monumental cathedral dates back to the colonial period. After the conquest of Mexico-Tenochtitl√°n, Hern√°n Cort√©s ordered the construction of a first major church in 1524, built with stones from destroyed indigenous temples and strategically located where the four causeways leading to the Aztec spiritual center converged. However, this initial construction soon proved insufficient for the spiritual needs of the viceroyalty's capital. Construction of the current cathedral formally began in 1573, under the direction of the Spanish architect Claudio de Arciniega, who was inspired by the cathedrals of Ja√©n and Valladolid. The project represented a titanic undertaking that spanned 240 years, concluding in 1813 under the direction of architect Manuel Tols√°.
Architectural Features
The cathedral is an extraordinary compendium of architectural styles that reflects the different periods of its construction. Its main fa√ßade displays the Renaissance, Baroque, and Neoclassical styles that developed during the Viceroyalty. The dimensions of the temple are impressive: 61 meters wide by 128 meters long and 67 meters high to the top of the towers.
The interior consists of five naves with a transept, with 51 vaults, 74 arches, and 40 columns. The structure includes fourteen side chapels, each with its own character and artistic treasures. The floor is made of Tepeaca marble, and its walls and vaults are made of stone.
Artistic Treasures
Among the most notable artistic treasures is the Altar of the Kings, considered one of the masterpieces of Churrigueresque Baroque in the Americas. This magnificent work was created by Jer√≥nimo de Balb√°s between 1718 and 1725, and gilded by Francisco Mart√≠nez in 1736. The altarpiece measures 25 meters high, 13 meters wide, and 7 meters deep, and is made of carved white cedar wood covered with gold leaf. The Altar of Forgiveness, also by Jer√≥nimo de Balb√°s, is located in the central nave along with the Cathedral Choir, which features two magnificent organs. The paintings decorating the Altar of the Kings are by the prominent artist Juan Rodr√≠guez Ju√°rez, including ""The Assumption of the Virgin Mary"" and ""The Adoration of the Magi.""
The Z√≥calo: Historical Context
The cathedral is located in Constitution Square, popularly known as the Z√≥calo, which, at 46,800 square meters, is the second largest square in the world after Tiananmen Square. This square was named in honor of the C√°diz Constitution promulgated in 1812. The term ""Z√≥calo"" comes from the base built during the government of Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna to erect a commemorative column of independence. The foundation was never completed, but its base remained in place for several years. Since pre-Hispanic times, this space has been the spiritual, political, and cultural center of Mexico, serving as the setting for important historical events.
World Heritage Site
The Metropolitan Cathedral, along with the Historic Center of Mexico City, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1987. This recognition is due to its exceptional architectural value and historical significance as a testament to the fusion of Indigenous and Spanish cultures.",1934,Cathedral,Catholic church,Tourist attraction,,,Cathedral,Ricardo Garc√≠a,2025-07-10T06:11:37.806Z,en,,mexico city metropolitan cathedral jewel capitals zcalo metropolitan cathedral assumption blessed virgin mary heaven mexico city stands one emblematic majestic monuments latin america dominating north side zcalo plaza de la constitucin heart mexico citys historic center history construction history monumental cathedral dates back colonial period conquest mexicotenochtitln hernn corts ordered construction first major church built stones destroyed indigenous temples strategically located four causeways leading aztec spiritual center converged however initial construction soon proved insufficient spiritual needs viceroyaltys capital construction current cathedral formally began direction spanish architect claudio de arciniega inspired cathedrals jan valladolid project represented titanic undertaking spanned years concluding direction architect manuel tols architectural features cathedral extraordinary compendium architectural styles reflects different periods construction main faade displays renaissance baroque neoclassical styles developed viceroyalty dimensions temple impressive meters wide meters long meters high top towers interior consists five naves transept vaults arches columns structure includes fourteen side chapels character artistic treasures floor made tepeaca marble walls vaults made stone artistic treasures among notable artistic treasures altar kings considered one masterpieces churrigueresque baroque americas magnificent work created jernimo de balbs gilded francisco martnez altarpiece measures meters high meters wide meters deep made carved white cedar wood covered gold leaf altar forgiveness also jernimo de balbs located central nave along cathedral choir features two magnificent organs paintings decorating altar kings prominent artist juan rodrguez jurez including assumption virgin mary adoration magi zcalo historical context cathedral located constitution square popularly known zcalo square meters second largest square world tiananmen square square named honor cdiz constitution promulgated term zcalo comes base built government antonio lpez de santa anna erect commemorative column independence foundation never completed base remained place several years since prehispanic times space spiritual political cultural center mexico serving setting important historical events world heritage site metropolitan cathedral along historic center mexico city declared world heritage site unesco recognition due exceptional architectural value historical significance testament fusion indigenous spanish cultures,3

Everyone was happy. The staff all have good vibes and with Sergio leading, I can see he sets the tone. The food is so fresh and seasoned so perfectly. Sergio said that his recipes come from old Mexico City, very traditional. The margaritas are so delicious and they use fresh juices, no store bought mix. I had the Classico with Mezcal, instead of tequila. It comes with a sun-dried lime and has perfect balance. Not too sweet, not bitter, not too acidic, and a perfect amount of liquor. I love the refried beans-smooth, seasoned so well and a little touch of imported Mexican cheese that is nutty, and actually has flavor, as opposed to the normal bland cheese that many other restaurants serve. The Mexican rice has a hint of saffron with rich tomatoes. I usually don‚Äôt eat the rice but this rice is irresistible. I had the fajitas, the combo of steak and shrooms. The steak is smokey, with a tangy mouth-watering dose of lime. The shrooms are meaty and would make a great vegan or vegetarian meal. It comes with red peppers and onions that still have a bit of crunch. The chips are perfectly cooked, crisp and seasoned. They come in a brown paper bag and if your lucky, they may be right out of the fryer. The ambiance is fun and they have swings to sit on. The kids will love this and so do the adults. The music is also great. Sergio wanted me to try the birria taco and gave me one for free. So damn good. He also gave me some tamales to take home. He told me he likes to keep his prices reasonable and they are. Do yourself a favor, and eat there. I promise, you will leave happy. I can‚Äôt remember any restaurant owner giving free food, sitting at your table to talk about where you are from and expressing gratitude for dining at their establishment.

The dishes are beautifully presented and the portions adequate. Although the appetizer and snack are small, the main course is enough to satisfy.

It is pretty pathetic though if I‚Äôve been sitting at my table for 20 minutes, and a server has yet to even say Hello, much less take our drink order. They were closing at 9pm on this night, and we had come in about 10-15 minutes before 8pm. The restaurant was not busy by any means. I could count the amount of tables being taken up by other guests on 1, maybe 2 hands. Having worked in the food industry before, what I saw was pure laziness and lack of caring. Most of the staff (other than the gentleman bussing the tables) was too busy trying to do their closing shift tasks, talking to each other, hanging out by the POS stand.

My biggest disappointment was that when the waiter went around to give people their digital bills, he did not say that there was a group fee (20% for our group of only 8) and all I saw on the screen was the total. So I of course added a tip and paid. Thought the price seemed a little high so I sent myself a receipt and then found out about the group tip already added. The whole table ended up tipping twice.

"418 S Tejon St suite 100, Colorado Springs, CO 80903","food, service, bad, tacos, order, dont, even, like, time, good","Some positives:

The happy hour pricing is great, so sometimes we go for happy hour. The $3 tacos are very, very generously-sized for the price, and the chips+salsa are good. I often order grilled fish tacos, which are generally tasty and very filling. For non-HH dining, there are lots of options for carnivores to vegans and most things are intrinsically gluten free. It's nice to have a menu that is geared slightly more toward southern Mexico. The margaritas are done well and the beer selection is appropriate to the venue.

However, there are some pretty consistent issues:

The place smells intensely of the fryer. If you wear a jacket in, it will still smell awful a few days later. Not subtly either; the people around you will notice how awful you smell. This has been the case since they opened, and it's the primary reason we take breaks from Zocalo.

Certain food items are a little rough. The fried fish is grey and slimy and unpleasant to eat. The carne asada is grey and bland. Food items have come out with small mistakes regularly, such as missing salsa or a taco that was never garnished at all.

The beer is sometimes flat. I think there's a bit of a line pressure issue that a distributor could solve.

The range in quality of service is from awful to pretty good, with no clear indication of why it's sometimes so bad. We're often ignored for too long/indefinitely, or the order is taken wrong, or there's an issue with the check (or the gratuity entered at the end of the shift). Sometimes they are understaffed but we've noticed the same problems when they are heavily staffed.

Overall, the issues aren't enough to totally take away our desire to eat there occasionally, especially given happy hour pricing, but solving those issues would greatly enhance the experience.",2260,Mexican restaurant,Cocktail bar,Taco restaurant,,,Mexican restaurant,Andrew Combs (Shepherd),2024-03-02T17:27:16.426Z,,,positives happy hour pricing great sometimes go happy hour tacos generouslysized price chipssalsa good often order grilled fish tacos generally tasty filling nonhh dining lots options carnivores vegans things intrinsically gluten free nice menu geared slightly toward southern mexico margaritas done well beer selection appropriate venue however pretty consistent issues place smells intensely fryer wear jacket still smell awful days later subtly either people around notice awful smell case since opened primary reason take breaks zocalo certain food items little rough fried fish grey slimy unpleasant eat carne asada grey bland food items come small mistakes regularly missing salsa taco never garnished beer sometimes flat think theres bit line pressure issue distributor could solve range quality service awful pretty good clear indication sometimes bad often ignored longindefinitely order taken wrong theres issue check gratuity entered end shift sometimes understaffed weve noticed problems heavily staffed overall issues arent enough totally take away desire eat occasionally especially given happy hour pricing solving issues would greatly enhance experience,7

The fact that it took 10 minutes for the waitress to bring chips and salsa should‚Äôve been a warning for what was to come. We had chips and salsa that sat empty for 20 minutes. We also had our water bottle empty for well over 20 mins needing a refill. We looked all over for her to ask for a refill but did not see her for a while. Eventually she passed us after giving another table chips and salsa and still did not refill our chips or water. We continued to wait 30-40 minutes for our food, which for 2 people, is pretty excessive, we‚Äôre assuming she forgot to put in our order. Over that span of time we saw her maybe 2 times. She eventually came over when we flagged her down and she asked to refill the salsa. She came back with only the salsa and forgot the chips. She came back and said the chips were out and they were refrying them. When our food came finally came out she forgot both of our tacos and had to go back and get them. Then about 20 mins later after promising chips, she returned, but we were already finishing up. We waited another 15 minutes waiting for our check which never came so we had to go to the bar and ask them to get our waitress.

Overall, terrible service. Waitress will ignore and neglect you. The food isn‚Äôt bad but for the service and time it takes to receive your food, you‚Äôre better off eating elsewhere. I‚Äôd only recommend if you‚Äôre in a pinch for places open, not if you‚Äôre in a pinch for time.

Look no further mi amigos! This place is swingin (pun intended - the bar swing seats are great for the kids). The horchata is so creamy and the sprinkled cinnamon adds a nice touch. Little weird to see a charge for chips and salsa, but after having them I‚Äôd gladly try again (next time with guac!) - they were crispy, lightly oiled, and salty. Kids had the enchiladas - they went with server Katie‚Äôs recommendation of beef with red sauce and chicken with green. These meals come with rice and beans, but tacos do not. My wife and I had the tacos, which did not disappoint - the carne asada is bigger than normal but is delicious. I also tried the quesabirria and shrimp, also good (although the shrimp was breaded and I prefer grilled). The highlight of the night was when I asked for spicier salsa. Katie went back and asked Sergio if they had any and he just whipped me up a phenomenal chili diarbo, Serrano, habenero salsa. He came out to check on us and insisted we try the salsa in the el macho - pretty fantastic as well!

Walking through its streets is like taking a trip back in time, where each corner reveals a part of the rich heritage of the Mexican capital.

One of the main attractions is the Z√≥calo, one of the largest squares in the world, surrounded by impressive buildings such as the Metropolitan Cathedral and the National Palace, which houses the famous murals by Diego Rivera. These sites offer an in-depth look at the history and art of Mexico.

The Templo Mayor, located just steps from the Z√≥calo, is another highlight. The Aztec ruins and adjacent museum allow visitors to explore the city's pre-Hispanic past. As one ventures deeper into the Historic Center, one finds streets full of life, vibrant markets, and a variety of shops and restaurants offering everything from traditional crafts to delicious Mexican food.

The Historic Center is also home to important museums, such as the Museo del Palacio de Bellas Artes, known for its impressive Art Nouveau architecture and interior murals, and the Casa de los Azulejos, with its facade covered in Talavera tiles. The mix of colonial, modern and pre-Hispanic buildings creates a unique and charming urban landscape.

Visiting the Historic Center of Mexico City is an enriching experience that offers something for everyone: history, culture, art, gastronomy and vibrant urban life. It is a place where the past and present coexist harmoniously, inviting visitors to explore and discover the essence of Mexico City.",2461,Historical landmark,,,,,Historical landmark,Rafael Hernandez,2024-07-17T14:01:51.021Z,en,,historic center mexico city fascinating place encapsulates centuries history culture architecture walking streets like taking trip back time corner reveals part rich heritage mexican capital one main attractions zcalo one largest squares world surrounded impressive buildings metropolitan cathedral national palace houses famous murals diego rivera sites offer indepth look history art mexico templo mayor located steps zcalo another highlight aztec ruins adjacent museum allow visitors explore citys prehispanic past one ventures deeper historic center one finds streets full life vibrant markets variety shops restaurants offering everything traditional crafts delicious mexican food historic center also home important museums museo del palacio de bellas artes known impressive art nouveau architecture interior murals casa de los azulejos facade covered talavera tiles mix colonial modern prehispanic buildings creates unique charming urban landscape visiting historic center mexico city enriching experience offers something everyone history culture art gastronomy vibrant urban life place past present coexist harmoniously inviting visitors explore discover essence mexico city,3

- views of Plaza de Constituti√≥n and the buildings were incredible.
- food was top notch!  Our group chose to do the pick 3 option on the menu: Tirana ceviche, shrimp taco, filet taco, octopus, tlacoyo tacos, totoaba filet on mole, heirloom tomato salad, rib-eye, everything was absolutely delicious!
- perfect portion-size
- never felt rushed to finish an item
- heaters were flanking our table which helped as the temperature cooled outside.

Things I would change if we could:
- our choices of clothing! We were right at the front of the balcony which was fantastic for the amazing views but it was quite windy. I would have worn nice pants and brought a thicker sweater.

I had a very frustrating and disappointing experience at Balcon de Zocalo in Mexico City. While the food and views were beautiful, our visit was ultimately ruined by dishonesty and terrible customer service.

Last year, I went with a friend who attempted to pay with his Capital One card. The first card didn‚Äôt work, so he tried a second one, which also didn‚Äôt go through. When he went back to the first card, it finally worked. The staff assured us that the failed transactions were voided and would not be charged.

That turned out to be false. Both ‚Äúvoided‚Äù transactions went through, and we were charged multiple times for one meal. We‚Äôve been trying to get our money back since June of last year, and despite countless emails and calls, we‚Äôve gotten nothing but empty promises. We even had a Spanish-speaking friend from El Salvador call on our behalf, and they hung up on her. That kind of behavior strongly suggests a lack of honesty and integrity.

We‚Äôve also reached out repeatedly on Instagram and Facebook for almost a year‚Äîagain, no resolution. All we‚Äôve asked for is a simple receipt to prove to Capital One that the duplicate charges were fraudulent, and they refuse to provide even that.

It's deeply upsetting to be out hundreds of dollars after being told we wouldn‚Äôt be charged. As tourists, we expected more from a place as prominent as Balcon de Zocalo. If you're an American or international visitor, avoid paying by card here‚Äîyour money may not be safe.

What could have been a lovely experience turned into a nightmare. It's a shame that such a well-known establishment would operate in this way.

In addition, they offered a free menu at the restaurant (soups, salads, sadwiches, snacks, soft drinks, frozen drinks and beer) The restaurant staff were attentive and accommodating, making sure that all guests were well taken care of.

The hotel's location was also ideal for exploring the city. It was conveniently located near popular attractions and public transportation options, making it easy to get around. Additionally, the hotel provided helpful recommendations for nearby restaurants and activities.

Last but not least, the service at this hotel was top-notch. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was enjoyable and hassle-free. From housekeeping to the concierge, everyone was professional, friendly, and always ready to assist with any requests or inquiries.

My wife and I have been going to Zocalo for the past 9 months and it has quickly become one of our favorite spots in the Springs.  We love the food and their drink menu is spectacular but I think the part we like most is the staff and owner.  It‚Äôs rare, especially in today‚Äôs day and age, to go to the same restaurant and see the same staff over a long period of time and I think the fact that we see the same familiar faces each time we go in speaks volumes to the atmosphere and the vibe going on there.  The staff and bartenders are friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable and the owner is so humble and easy going.

Going back to the food, my wife and I love street tacos and have been to just about every spot in the Springs and we both agree Zocalo is our favorite.  The El Macho and Quesabirria are my favorite and my wife, as a pescatarian, loves the fact that she has so many options there (her favorite is the Equites)‚Ä¶ and if you‚Äôre there on the weekend don‚Äôt miss out on the Poke Nachos.  Their drink menu also has a lot of unique cocktails on it and we appreciate that all the drinks are made with real ingredients (no sour mix here).  The El Jefe and Mezcal Sour are great drinks but we find ourselves going back to the Mexican Blood and Sand more times than not.

I honestly can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place, we initially went for the food and drink but find ourselves coming back over and over again for the vibe and the people.

I recently visited Mexico City's Historic Center, and the experience was much more than a sightseeing tour: it was a journey through time and the many identities that coexist here. From the moment you arrive, it's impossible not to feel the weight of history and the vibrant energy that surrounds it.

This is where you'll find some of the country's most iconic sites, such as the Z√≥calo, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the National Palace, and the Templo Mayor. Everything is close by and easy to explore on foot. Every corner has something to tell: stunning architecture, street art, traditional sounds like organ grinders, and the comings and goings of people that keep everything moving.

What surprised me most was the mix of old and new. You can see colonial buildings alongside modern shops, interactive museums, galleries, restaurants, and charming cafes. I highly recommend visiting the Palacio de Bellas Artes (both inside and out) and the Casa de los Azulejos. There are also many museums for those who enjoy art and history, such as the MUNAL (Mexican Museum of Art and History) and the Templo Mayor Museum.

The food is also excellent. From street vendors selling tacos, tlacoyos, and ice creams to places serving more elaborate traditional Mexican food, there are options for all budgets.

Of course, as in any urban center, you should be careful with your belongings and avoid lonely streets at night. Security has improved significantly, and there is police presence in the busiest areas, but it's always a good idea to proceed with caution.",2961,Cathedral,Catholic church,Tourist attraction,,,Cathedral,David Sanchez,2025-06-22T04:56:27.806Z,en,,unique experience blends history culture urban life recently visited mexico citys historic center experience much sightseeing tour journey time many identities coexist moment arrive impossible feel weight history vibrant energy surrounds youll find countrys iconic sites zcalo metropolitan cathedral national palace templo mayor everything close easy explore foot every corner something tell stunning architecture street art traditional sounds like organ grinders comings goings people keep everything moving surprised mix old new see colonial buildings alongside modern shops interactive museums galleries restaurants charming cafes highly recommend visiting palacio de bellas artes inside casa de los azulejos also many museums enjoy art history munal mexican museum art history templo mayor museum food also excellent street vendors selling tacos tlacoyos ice creams places serving elaborate traditional mexican food options budgets course urban center careful belongings avoid lonely streets night security improved significantly police presence busiest areas always good idea proceed caution,3

Its fa√ßade alone is a symphony of styles, a living chronicle etched in stone, spanning from the restrained austerity of its early Renaissance foundations to the exuberant flourish of its Baroque and Neoclassical embellishments. Twin bell towers pierce the sky, their intricate carvings and statuary reaching towards the heavens, while the central dome, a masterful feat of engineering, crowns the edifice with majestic grace.
Within, the grandeur continues. Soaring vaulted ceilings draw the eye upward, supported by massive columns that create a sense of profound scale. Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass windows, casts a kaleidoscope of colors across polished floors and gilded altarpieces, illuminating the rich tapestry of religious art. Every chapel, every corner, reveals meticulous craftsmanship: elaborate Churrigueresque retablos shimmering with gold leaf, delicate Rococo details whispering tales of devotion, and solemn Neoclassical forms exuding an air of dignified reverence.

We came for a 7:15 reservation and was able to be sat a bit before, which was perfect to see the sunset. I had the tepache and my girlfriend had the pornstar martini. We shared the blanco loco. The tepache was perfect- not too sweet and the mezcal smoky flavor held strong. The pornstar martini was nice, the maracuya flavor was prominent, but we wished there was more vanilla flavor. The blanco loco is sweet but delicious and an interesting texture.

We shared the four course menu and chose: the oysters, the crab taco, the beef mole and the chocolate cake. We were not very hungry so it was the perfect amount for the both of us. The oysters had many different textures which was interesting, but a bit overwhelming on the palette. I believe it contained miso glaze, but could not taste the umami flavor. The crab taco was lovely. A nice blend of textures (crunchy fried crab, onions and aioli) and flavors (avocado, lime and sweet crab). The star of the show was definitely the beef. Perfectly cooked, it tasted like butter and a wonderful mole sauce. The chicharr√≥n balls and asparagus/brussel sprouts made for some interesting texture and flavor combinations. The chocolate cake dessert was light, creamy and buttery. Our waiter, Fabian, was very attentive and gave us great recommendations.

"418 S Tejon St suite 100, Colorado Springs, CO 80903","food, service, bad, tacos, order, dont, even, like, time, good","I was very disappointed from my experience. I have thought about my review for two months.

The initial complication started with the order to order a taco. I had questions. She didn't understand my simple questions about the ingredients of the specific tacos I was inquiring about (the vegetarian options). Ultimately, I wanted to know what the ingredients were and if it was free of animal products. My friend and I were able to decipher that she didn't know. When she came back to bring my friend's queso, and to take her order, I had a couple more questions about customizing my order. The server just couldn't comprehend. I tried four times to ask my questions. To restate my questions. Rephrase my questions and then I thought maybe I am not speaking well enough. So, my friend, who's a very articulate and great at projecting rephrased and reframe exactly what I was asking. No, there was not a a language barrier.

The request was to remove one ingredient from a taco. Or option 2, was was to apply the Portabella mushroom  mushroom to a different taco as the protein. It blew her mind. Following the conversation about customizing the taco I just gave up.  She went to go ask somebody in the kitchen. I don't even think she knew what she was asking. Even if she asked. While she was away, I asked my friend if I was not speaking clearly, or how I could've worded that more clearly and more understandable. She said, I think you were very clear.

The server returned. I wanted to make this a simple for everybody.  I will order the portobello taco with no cheese or creama. When the food arrived. Of course, there was creama on the taco. Yet the cheese was not present. Close, but still deadly. They remade the taco.

My incomprehensible request was the CAMOTE AL PASTOR taco with the Portabella mushroom added as a protein. That's all.

I ended up with the PANELA MUSHROOM, no cheese and creama.

While are they prepared our tacos, I noticed the water glass had red lipstick on it. As a result, I took a closer look. It was unwashed. Completely. Fingerprints and all. At this point I drank almost half of the water. Note, the server was very gracious, embarrassed and apologetic. They replaced my right away. Yes this can happen. It's disgusting. I'm not sure how it happened. At this point, I was really hopeful that the food redeem this place. Because the ambience was great, aside from the loud music.

When the mushroom taco arrived, it was simply a mushroom, with sauce, arugula on a tortilla. I asked for a side of avocado slices. She brings me smashed avocado, which they call guacamole. Which is OK. I just needed something to add flavor and a little more value to my taco. The flavor didn't change much. And I love avocado.

They did not charge me for the Avocado/guacamole due to the dirty water glass. That's very much appreciated. And I want to acknowledge that.

What's a taco good? No. Was it filling? No. It was lacking density and flavor. Also substance. I would love to have ordered more, but I was not going to even try based on the in accuracy and the lack of flavor or taste. I just left hungry.

My friend did enjoy her chips and queso. Her toco was ""okay"" as it lacked flavor. I don't recall which taco she ordered but it was an animal protein taco.

That taco isn't worth of five dollars. That taco isn't worth $1.50.

You will leave smelling like tacos. My coworkers new I had tacos for lunch. From two offices from away, he smelled me and my clothes. It's not a bad smell, but in a modern restaurant I don't think I should smell like a taco shop..

I do not recommend this place. I have no plans of going back. Many other people have had a very different experiences than I.

I don't understand, due to the computer in her hand, and from her knowledge, she could not request that the Portabella mushroom be added to a taco.  Perhaps the training gap. But also, you can add a note that says side of Portabella mushroom. Or place Portabella mushroom on this taco.

The space itself is beautiful, and the staff were friendly when we arrived, but unfortunately that‚Äôs where the positives end. The food was a major letdown, and that‚Äôs putting it lightly. Even for a group of adventurous eaters, the flavor combinations were strange and didn‚Äôt work. A standout oddity: no real butter, just a strange coffee butter. But the real issue came with the steak.

One of our dishes came out completely raw, not rare or even medium-rare. raw. We sent it back immediately, and instead of correcting the issue, they simply removed the plate‚Ä¶ and still charged us full price. No apology, no attempt to make it right.

To make matters worse, we had come specifically because we saw guacamole promoted online only to be told they didn‚Äôt serve it anymore.

With a rich history spanning from pre-Hispanic times to the present day, this plaza is a reflection of Mexican national identity.

*History and Significance*

- In pre-Hispanic times, the Z√≥calo was part of the Templo Mayor, an important ceremonial center of the Aztecs.
- After the Spanish conquest, the Plaza Mayor was built, which became the political and religious center of the city.
- In 1813, it was officially named Plaza de la Constituci√≥n in honor of the Constitution of C√°diz.
- The name ""Z√≥calo"" comes from an unfinished project by Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna to build a monument to Independence in the center of the square. Only the base, or z√≥calo, was placed, and it remained in place for years.

*Buildings and Monuments*

- *Metropolitan Cathedral*: one of the city's most important churches, built on the ruins of the Aztec Templo Mayor.
- *National Palace*: seat of the federal executive branch, built on the site of Moctezuma's palace.
- *Templo Mayor*: an archaeological site and museum housing the remains of the Aztec civilization.
- *City Hall*: seat of the Mexico City government.

*Current Issues*

- The presence of street vendors in the plaza is a controversial issue, as some believe it affects the aesthetics and functionality of the public space.

In short, the Plaza de la Constituci√≥n is an iconic place that reflects Mexico's rich history and culture. Although it faces current challenges, it remains an important political, religious, and cultural center of the city.",3525,Plaza,Historical place,Tourist attraction,,,Plaza,Ricardo Zorraquin Cornejo,2025-08-27T04:42:46.055Z,en,,constitution square also known zcalo iconic location heart mexico city rich history spanning prehispanic times present day plaza reflection mexican national identity history significance prehispanic times zcalo part templo mayor important ceremonial center aztecs spanish conquest plaza mayor built became political religious center city officially named plaza de la constitucin honor constitution cdiz name zcalo comes unfinished project antonio lpez de santa anna build monument independence center square base zcalo placed remained place years buildings monuments metropolitan cathedral one citys important churches built ruins aztec templo mayor national palace seat federal executive branch built site moctezumas palace templo mayor archaeological site museum housing remains aztec civilization city hall seat mexico city government current issues presence street vendors plaza controversial issue believe affects aesthetics functionality public space short plaza de la constitucin iconic place reflects mexicos rich history culture although faces current challenges remains important political religious cultural center city,3

The food here was the best we have had and great value.
We started with wine all from Mexico. Choices limited however we were happy with our choices. Next we had the salad with bacon and spiced nuts. Tacos we had the fish and octopus. Fish was better. Next steak and fish. The steak was perfectly cooked and the mustard sauce was a perfect compliment.  The fish was very good but the steak was better.  Lastly we had a slight communication lapse where I got the almond ice cream and cream cone and my daughter got the sorbet.  She is gluten free and we thought we ordered two sorbets but it was fine   We just did nit share that item.  They also brought gluten free crackers instead of bread.  Very accommodating.

While the price can feel a bit steep‚Äîit almost feels like a ""daytime robbery"" at times‚Äîthe magnificent views you get from the observation decks make it almost worth the expense.
We visited in late August and found the crowd to be moderate. We didn't have to wait in any excessively long lines, and the staff was friendly and efficient, making the whole process easy to navigate. The accessibility is a big plus, and there is plenty of parking available in the area, which takes a lot of stress out of the visit.
From the top, you get a breathtaking panoramic view of the city, Lake Ontario, and beyond. The glass floor is a thrilling experience and a great photo opportunity.

Now, sometimes I keep ordering, not because I like it or love it, but because it's the least bad.
Also, I don't know if it happens to you, but the more times I order, the more ugly and sloppy they send me. It seems that instead of feeling flattered and committed, it makes them angry that I keep ordering.
The Tupperware arrives stained with marks or fingerprints from cream, salsa, etc. The portions are smaller and more expensive. When I order two pozoles, they send the condiments (lettuce, lemons, onion, etc.) only for one pozole, and once they didn't send anything, just the pozole and tostadas for one. If they don't have them anymore, at least let us know so we know if we still want it or not, or cancel the order promptly.
I really liked ordering chilaquiles with steak, but I stopped ordering them because they were more like skin than meat‚Äîpractically skin or tough meat, if you will.
I find the quesadillas very expensive for how small they are.
The flautas sometimes come with a decent portion of chicken and other times with a rough portion.
It's worth mentioning that their menu is practically all tortillas (chilaquiles, enchiladas, flautas, quesadillas, sopes) with decent chicken, but I don't recommend them with steak.
Finally, they raised the prices and reduced the portions.
The tinga (pork) by the gram doesn't say what kind of meat it is; I think it's pork, but they don't mention it, even though they include government-mandated inscriptions, the ingredients are unclear, and their flavor is average, acceptable.
In short, sometimes I keep ordering them, not because I like them or love them, but because they're the least bad.",4082,Mexican restaurant,,,,,Mexican restaurant,Ivonne Glez.,2025-08-14T11:08:40.692Z,en,,first times ordered tasty adequate portion neither little much good price carefully served sometimes keep ordering like love least bad also dont know happens times order ugly sloppy send seems instead feeling flattered committed makes angry keep ordering tupperware arrives stained marks fingerprints cream salsa etc portions smaller expensive order two pozoles send condiments lettuce lemons onion etc one pozole didnt send anything pozole tostadas one dont anymore least let us know know still want cancel order promptly really liked ordering chilaquiles steak stopped ordering like skin meatpractically skin tough meat find quesadillas expensive small flautas sometimes come decent portion chicken times rough portion worth mentioning menu practically tortillas chilaquiles enchiladas flautas quesadillas sopes decent chicken dont recommend steak finally raised prices reduced portions tinga pork gram doesnt say kind meat think pork dont mention even though include governmentmandated inscriptions ingredients unclear flavor average acceptable short sometimes keep ordering like love theyre least bad,7

I had a large red pozole with chicken ($99), and it was served fast and hot, with a generous amount of chicken. However, I highly recommend some lime and a little powdered red pepper. That took the dish from a 3 to a 4.5. There are a ton of servers working there, so just get someone's attention and you will get what you need fast.

La Casa de To√±o, and the Arag√≥n branch in particular, is for me the ultimate place for Mexican antojitos. They've achieved something incredible: bringing the experience of a traditional neighborhood pozoleria to a chain model without sacrificing flavor.

What I love:

The food is a 10/10: The pozole is consistently delicious, with an authentic, comforting flavor. The rest of the antojitos are simply exquisite. They never disappoint.

The Customer Experience: The service is excellent. Their system is so efficient that from the moment you arrive until you leave, everything flows seamlessly. They are fast, attentive, and never fail to deliver.

An important observation:

The Staff's Work Rate: As a customer, I enjoy impeccable service. However, I can't help but notice the immense pressure the team seems to be working under. The waiters and captains move at a breakneck pace without stopping. While this results in amazing efficiency, it leaves me feeling like a lot is being demanded of them. It's a recognition of the enormous effort they put in.

In short:

The dining experience is first-class, and I always leave more than satisfied. It's my go-to spot when I'm craving Mexican food.

"100 Queens Park, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada","food, service, bad, tacos, order, dont, even, like, time, good","So, I've been stewing on this since Saturday when we went to The R.O.M. for the first time. We (myself, my husband, our adult kids  with one spouse and our granddaughter)  drove almost 3 hours specifically to see the Auschwitz exhibit. Something that is near to my heart because my Nana was a Polish slave during WWII .
We continously checked the website on our way there to make sure time slots were available and at no time did it give any indication the time slots were getting full.
We arrived shortly before 1 p.m. and were advised all time slots were full except 3:40 p.m. .
The person who was helping us purchase tickets for that slot also told us there were only 2 available for that time. But, advised us it was OK. There would be no problem having 4 extra people. He also advised us our best bet was to buy the tickets that allowed us into the other exhibit, the Flemish 300 years of art exhibit.  Assuring us we would have time for both.
We proceeded to buy those tickets to the tune of almost 200 dollars.
He advised us to browse the other areas of the museum (several areas blocked off due to exhibit updates etc). We enjoyed what we were able to see and approximately 30 mins before our alloted time to visit the Auschwitz exhibit made our way back to the elevators to go to that floor.
We were met with a mess. People crowded into the area by the elevators. No one knew where to be. Workers blocking the elevators saying we were unable to go up yet and virtually everyone saying they had tickets for 3:40.
Eventually we were corralled into a line and stood in that line well beyond our alloted time ( 4:40 before we even made it to the elevator. All the while being offered tickets to come another day because *we didn't expect so many people* by museum staff wandering through the line. Interestingly enough we were encouraged to complain to management by these same  staff members.
When we finally got to the entrance of the display it was beyond hot. People were crammed into a small area to wait to get beyond the waiting area.
Once inside there was very little time to actually look at anything before people were being herded in behind us. We spent most of our time waiting for the crowd ahead of us to move forward.
The displays were sparse and consisted mostly of pictures with a few artifacts .
3/4 of the way through the loudspeaker began announcing the museum was closed. Loudly enough that any information being given on the headsets was drowned out.
So, not only were we unable to take a reasonable amount of time to view this important historical information we were unable to even go to the other exhibit we paid to see.
They did refund our money. They also gave us tickets to see the display we missed out on but after the disorganized mess we were shuttled through,  I hesitate to even attempt the journey.
I have honestly seen better displays and organization at little roadside museums in off the beaten track towns.
So disappointing.
I wanted so very much to love this museum and the exhibit we came specifically to see but definitely did not.
What should have been a journey to see what our Nana lived through left us just hot,  sweaty and not even a little more educated than we were when we arrived.",4734,Art museum,Museum,Natural history museum,Tourist attraction,,Art museum,kyafirst,2025-08-25T20:56:10.388Z,,,ive stewing since saturday went rom first time husband adult kids one spouse granddaughter drove almost hours specifically see auschwitz exhibit something near heart nana polish slave wwii continously checked website way make sure time slots available time give indication time slots getting full arrived shortly pm advised time slots full except pm person helping us purchase tickets slot also told us available time advised us ok would problem extra people also advised us best bet buy tickets allowed us exhibit flemish years art exhibit assuring us would time proceeded buy tickets tune almost dollars advised us browse areas museum several areas blocked due exhibit updates etc enjoyed able see approximately mins alloted time visit auschwitz exhibit made way back elevators go floor met mess people crowded area elevators one knew workers blocking elevators saying unable go yet virtually everyone saying tickets eventually corralled line stood line well beyond alloted time even made elevator offered tickets come another day didnt expect many people museum staff wandering line interestingly enough encouraged complain management staff members finally got entrance display beyond hot people crammed small area wait get beyond waiting area inside little time actually look anything people herded behind us spent time waiting crowd ahead us move forward displays sparse consisted mostly pictures artifacts way loudspeaker began announcing museum closed loudly enough information given headsets drowned unable take reasonable amount time view important historical information unable even go exhibit paid see refund money also gave us tickets see display missed disorganized mess shuttled hesitate even attempt journey honestly seen better displays organization little roadside museums beaten track towns disappointing wanted much love museum exhibit came specifically see definitely journey see nana lived left us hot sweaty even little educated arrived,7

As with all Casa To√±o restaurants, the food is good and affordable. That day we tried:
‚Ä¢ Steak tacos: very tasty and generous portions for the price.
‚Ä¢ Minced pork tostadas: hearty and delicious.
‚Ä¢ Potato and cheese quesadilla: highly recommended.
‚Ä¢ Dessert: coffee with vanilla concha, also quite good.

The advantages of this place are clear: speed, flavor, and price. You'll rarely find anything negative, although it's true that the dishes are delicious without being extraordinary.

In short: Casa To√±o is a highly recommended place for any time of day, whether breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

For dessert I highly recommend the flan de cajeta de la abuela and for drinks there is a great variety from aguas frescas, soft drinks to beers. I recommend the place because the service is quite fast, maybe at the reception you can wait up to 10 minutes but once you are inside the service is fast, so I suggest by education in Mexico leave at least 10% tip as a basis, this varies depending on the service you receive from the waiters.

I followed all the steps: I shared my location in real time and wrote my full address, which was confirmed by their team. Until then, everything is correct.

I received a tracking link through Uber, but when the delivery driver left I noticed that they sent the order to the wrong address. I contacted the delivery person, but he told me that he could not change the address and that I had to deliver it as is. If I cannot deliver it, I would return it to the restaurant.

I immediately contacted La Casa de To√±o's WhatsApp service. After much insistence, they told me that I would have to personally go to the branch for the order, that they would only keep it for an hour and that, if I didn't go, they would throw it away. They rejected any type of refund or solution, arguing that this is what their terms and conditions indicate.

The unfair thing is that I did correctly provide my location and address, which was confirmed by them, therefore the ""wrong address"" policy does not apply. The most disappointing thing was the lack of empathy, real care and solutions. I also called customer service and they told me that they could only assist me through WhatsApp, to repeat the same thing: ""There are no refunds or resends.""

I recommend being very careful when placing orders via WhatsApp with La Casa de To√±o. Their system has flaws, their service is slow, and in the event of an error they are not responsible, even if the error was theirs.

My son has low muscle tone, developmental delays, and is autistic. Upon arrival, we were told to check in our wagon and were offered a stroller as an alternative. Unfortunately, the stroller provided was undersized, causing his feet to drag on the ground. This discomfort triggered sensory issues, prompting him to remove his shoes repeatedly throughout the visit.

We rely on a wagon during outings to carry his essentials such as diapers and water, and to provide a sense of comfort and security. Additionally, it helps reduce the uncomfortable attention he sometimes receives when using a stroller due to his age and size.

What was especially disheartening was seeing other families inside the museum using wagons, which made the situation feel inconsistent and unfair.

Despite not booking ahead, we barely queued to buy our tickets and then go up to the top. Note that we went up towards the end of the afternoon to catch the sunset. Which we did! The different viewpoints are worth it. However, at the beginning of the visit, the Tower staff takes pictures of the visitors as souvenir. We were very surprised to discover at the end of our visit that the pictures were already printed, but that they costed $45 + taxes. If you don‚Äôt buy them, they get shredded. What a waste of resources! We didn‚Äôt buy them because of the outrageous price (equivalent to a one-person ticket up the tower).

This exhibit was fascinating, thorough, and well thought out. The audio device with headphones was fabulous. The artifacts were thoughtfully chosen, with detailed information about them. The replicas/ and or the actual artifacts were perfectly preserved. The videos/audio gave a lot of life to the exhibit and really demonstrated what happened in Auschwitz to its victims. I especially loved the probably lesser known people, i.e. the carpenter who made a box for the SS after his skills were discovered. I did find the exhibits/displays a bit confusing. It was hard to figure out where to start in each room after the big red signs introducing each room. Before you go, you need to read up on the camps/WW2. I think it would be confusing if you did not know what happened. I don't think it is a place for children-only because of the density of the content. There is a lot of reading, listening, and watching. I spent 3 hours there and I don't think the parents/ adults with kids would get the same kind of experience. Also, the parents/ adults would get distracted with the kids and not focus on the exhibit. What I really found interesting was the silence.....everyone had their headphones on and even in between the audio excerpts, people were quiet. It was a respectful environment and conducive to learning. I do wish there was someone at the end I could have asked questions.

From historical artifacts to species displays, crystals, diaspores, and cultural history exhibits, there was so much to take in. The museum does a great job of curating items from different time periods and parts of the world, offering a rich blend of natural history, art, and culture.

Today I decided to order from the same branch through Uber and it was horrible, almost 400 pesos for 2 chilaquiles, miserable in quantity.

Excited to share about the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) in Toronto! üá®üá¶

This is a special moment in my journey of exploring the world‚Äôs history and culture.

Founded in 1914, the Royal Ontario Museum is one of North America‚Äôs largest museums, dedicated to natural history, world cultures, and art. Over the decades, ROM has become a hub for learning, research, and global heritage, attracting millions of visitors every year. Its Michael Lee-Chin Crystal, a modern architectural addition, beautifully blends contemporary design with historical elegance.

From the Australian art galleries that inspired creativity,
to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial that taught reflection and hope,
and the Auckland War Museum that honored bravery and history,
each visit has enriched my perspective.

Now, ROM adds a Canadian chapter with its amazing artifacts, dinosaur skeletons, and world cultures. Its treasures and iconic architecture make it a must-visit for anyone passionate about history and art.

Every museum I visit connects me more deeply to human creativity, resilience, and heritage.

Can‚Äôt wait to explore and learn more!",7021,Art museum,Museum,Natural history museum,Tourist attraction,,Art museum,Mahbubur Rahman,2025-08-16T16:55:02.304Z,,,alhamdulillah excited share royal ontario museum rom toronto special moment journey exploring worlds history culture founded royal ontario museum one north americas largest museums dedicated natural history world cultures art decades rom become hub learning research global heritage attracting millions visitors every year michael leechin crystal modern architectural addition beautifully blends contemporary design historical elegance australian art galleries inspired creativity hiroshima peace memorial taught reflection hope auckland war museum honored bravery history visit enriched perspective rom adds canadian chapter amazing artifacts dinosaur skeletons world cultures treasures iconic architecture make mustvisit anyone passionate history art every museum visit connects deeply human creativity resilience heritage cant wait explore learn,3

The food is expensive and not exactly the best. It is annoying that they charge you for everything extra. The flautas, which was what I ordered, were stuffed with lettuce, cream and cheese, but I had the impression that they were frozen and were not very good. The water was expensive compared to the quantity; you would have to order two or three glasses. The pozole was of average quality, with no differentiator compared to a pozole from the Garibaldi or Morelos markets.",8261,Mexican restaurant,Breakfast restaurant,Restaurant,,,Mexican restaurant,Psic Arturo Segovia,2024-03-07T06:06:46.586Z,en,,opinion place whose fame guarantees excellent service quality price food expensive exactly best annoying charge everything extra flautas ordered stuffed lettuce cream cheese impression frozen good water expensive compared quantity would order two three glasses pozole average quality differentiator compared pozole garibaldi morelos markets,7
